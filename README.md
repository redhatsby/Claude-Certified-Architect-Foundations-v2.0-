# Claude-Certified-Architect-Foundations-v2.0-
Practice Test 1: Claude Certified Architect Foundations (v2.0) - Results


Question 1
Correct
Scenario: Multi-Agent Research System You are building a multi-agent research system using the Claude Agent SDK. A coordinator agent delegates to specialized subagents: one searches the web, one analyzes documents, one synthesizes findings, and one generates reports. The system researches topics and produces comprehensive, cited reports. Quality audits show that reports covering 25 or more source documents have uneven validation quality. Early sources receive detailed citation checks, later sources receive superficial checks, and the same evidence weakness is sometimes accepted in one source but rejected in another. What task decomposition change would most effectively improve review consistency?

Your answer is correct
Run focused document-level evidence checks first, then perform a separate cross-document consistency pass before synthesis and reporting.
Explanation
This separates local source validation from global consistency analysis, reducing attention dilution across many documents. Each source receives comparable scrutiny before a later pass examines conflicts, repeated weaknesses, and cross-source implications.
Increase the coordinator loop limit so the synthesis agent can keep revisiting sources until quality appears acceptable.
Explanation
An arbitrary iteration cap is an anti-pattern when used as the primary mechanism for quality control. It does not guarantee balanced source coverage, and judging whether quality appears acceptable can still miss systematic gaps.
Ask the synthesis agent to analyze all source documents in one prompt using stronger instructions about consistency.
Explanation
A single large prompt does not solve the attention dilution that appears when many sources compete for focus. Stronger instructions may help marginally, but they still leave one agent juggling local validation, cross-source comparison, synthesis, and reporting at once.
Have every subagent review the full source bundle independently and report only issues found by most agents.
Explanation
This majority-vote pattern is inefficient and can suppress real issues that only one focused reviewer catches. It also duplicates work across subagents rather than decomposing the task into distinct, complementary passes.
Overall explanation
Focused decomposition improves reliability when a review spans many inputs because each pass has a narrower objective. Running document-level evidence checks first ensures each source is examined with comparable depth, while a later cross-document pass can focus on conflicts, duplicated claims, inconsistent standards, and synthesis readiness.

The underlying principle is to reduce attention dilution by separating local analysis from integration analysis. This mirrors prompt chaining patterns where large reviews are decomposed into focused passes rather than handled as one broad prompt.

Asking one synthesis agent to review everything with stronger wording leaves the original failure mode intact. Majority voting across subagents wastes effort and may hide rare but important findings. Increasing loop limits is also unreliable because arbitrary iteration counts do not define what good coverage or consistency means.

Question 2
Correct
Scenario: Multi-Agent Research System You are building a multi-agent research system using the Claude Agent SDK. A coordinator agent delegates to specialized subagents: one searches the web, one analyzes documents, one synthesizes findings, and one generates reports. The system researches topics and produces comprehensive, cited reports. During testing, the document analysis subagent receives coordinator-selected PDFs and reports from an approved catalog, but it has a generic URL retrieval tool. It sometimes follows links inside documents to blogs, login pages, or duplicate HTML summaries, then cites those pages instead of the approved sources. You need reduce these citation and scope errors while preserving access to approved source material. What change best addresses this?
Your answer is correct
Replace fetch_url with a load_document tool that accepts catalog document IDs or approved URLs and validates before fetching.
Explanation
A constrained tool narrows the action space to the document analysis agent's intended role and prevents it from retrieving arbitrary linked content. Validating catalog document IDs or approved URLs preserves necessary access while reducing misuse caused by an overly generic retrieval capability.
Give the document analysis subagent web search tools too, so it can independently confirm whether linked pages are relevant.
Explanation
Expanding the subagent's tool set worsens the scope problem by increasing opportunities for cross-specialization behavior. The document analysis agent should analyze assigned documents, not independently broaden the research corpus through web search.
Keep fetch_url available, but add prompt instructions warning the subagent never to open links found inside documents.
Explanation
Prompt instructions may reduce mistakes, but they do not constrain the tool interface or guarantee compliance. The observed issue is caused by overly broad tool capability, so relying on instructions leaves the same failure mode available.
Allow fetch_url for any link, then have synthesis discard citations whose domains are not in the approved catalog.
Explanation
Post-filtering citations is a late-stage cleanup strategy that allows polluted context and unsupported intermediate conclusions to reach synthesis. It also fails when disallowed pages influence summaries even if their citations are later removed.
Overall explanation
Constrained tool design is the best fit when a subagent needs a narrow capability, such as loading approved research documents, but a generic tool lets it wander outside its role. Replacing fetch_url with a purpose-specific load_document interface reduces ambiguity, validates inputs, and makes the correct behavior easier for the model to choose.

The underlying principle is scoped tool access: each subagent should receive tools aligned with its specialization, with generic or cross-role tools avoided unless they are genuinely needed. This improves reliability because the model's decision space is smaller and the tool contract encodes operational boundaries rather than relying only on natural language guidance.

Prompt warnings are weaker because they depend on probabilistic compliance while leaving the unsafe action available. Adding web search tools expands the agent beyond document analysis and increases misuse risk. Post-filtering citations is also an anti-pattern because bad sources can still shape intermediate reasoning before the final report is cleaned up.

Question 3
Incorrect
Scenario: Developer Productivity with Claude You are building developer productivity tools using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent helps engineers explore unfamiliar codebases, understand legacy systems, generate boilerplate code, and automate repetitive tasks. It uses built-in tools (Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob) and integrates with MCP servers. An engineer asks the agent to add a caching layer around a legacy authorization module. The codebase has multiple tenants, audit logging, and inconsistent invalidation behavior, and the team has little domain knowledge. Past attempts produced working code that later failed on stale permissions and compliance edge cases. What should the engineer do before asking Claude to modify files?
Your answer is incorrect
Provide a long prose description of desired performance goals and let Claude infer domain rules from surrounding code.
Explanation
Performance goals alone do not define authorization invariants, invalidation semantics, or audit requirements. Letting Claude infer domain rules from inconsistent legacy code can produce confident but incorrect implementation choices.
Tell Claude to copy caching patterns from a different module, assuming consistency across legacy authorization and unrelated services.
Explanation
Reusing patterns can be useful only after confirming that the same invariants and failure modes apply. Authorization caching has specific correctness and compliance risks, so copying unrelated service patterns may preserve the wrong behavior.
Correct answer
Have Claude first ask targeted questions about invariants, invalidation triggers, audit requirements, and failure modes before proposing implementation.
Explanation
This uses the interview pattern to surface requirements and hidden constraints before implementation begins. For unfamiliar domains with compliance and correctness risks, clarifying assumptions upfront reduces rework and prevents Claude from filling gaps with plausible but wrong defaults.
Ask Claude to implement the simplest cache wrapper immediately, then iterate only if tests or reviewers expose issues.
Explanation
This is a reactive anti-pattern when the domain has known hidden constraints and prior failures. Waiting for reviewers or tests to discover stale permission and compliance issues increases rework and may miss requirements that were never encoded in tests.
Overall explanation
The best approach is to use the interview pattern before implementation. When engineers are working in an unfamiliar domain, Claude can ask targeted questions to uncover assumptions about invariants, cache invalidation, audit requirements, customer impact, and failure behavior before touching files.

The underlying principle is that iterative refinement is not only about fixing code after it exists. It is also about improving the problem definition before implementation, especially when missing requirements could produce correct-looking code with unsafe behavior.

Immediate implementation followed by reviewer feedback is an anti-pattern for high-risk legacy behavior because the important constraints may not be visible in the first failing test. Long prose performance goals and copied patterns also fail because they encourage Claude to infer domain rules rather than explicitly validating them.

Question 4
Correct
Scenario: Multi-Agent Research System You are building a multi-agent research system using the Claude Agent SDK. A coordinator agent delegates to specialized subagents: one searches the web, one analyzes documents, one synthesizes findings, and one generates reports. The system researches topics and produces comprehensive, cited reports. Your document-analysis subagent receives 45 reports and policy papers in a single pass before synthesis. The final outputs cite many sources but miss source-specific caveats, merge incompatible methodologies, and sometimes contradict earlier extracted facts. What workflow change would most effectively improve reliability?
Partition sources randomly across parallel subagents, concatenate their summaries, and have the report agent polish the combined narrative.
Explanation
Parallelization can help scale review, but random partitioning and concatenation do not create a deliberate integration step. The report agent may produce fluent text while preserving hidden contradictions, duplicated claims, or incompatible methodologies.
Your answer is correct
Analyze each source in a focused pass with structured findings, then run a separate cross-source integration pass before reporting.
Explanation
This uses prompt chaining to separate local source analysis from cross-source synthesis. Focused passes reduce attention dilution, while the integration pass can compare methodologies, resolve contradictions, and preserve caveats before report generation.
Set a maximum number of synthesis iterations and stop once the report includes citations from every source category.
Explanation
An arbitrary iteration cap is an anti-pattern when used as the primary reliability mechanism. Citation coverage by category does not prove that source-specific caveats, conflicting evidence, or methodological differences were analyzed correctly.
Send all sources to the synthesis agent together and instruct it to be more careful with citations and contradictions.
Explanation
This keeps the same overloaded single-pass structure that produced the reliability issues. A stronger instruction may help marginally, but it does not address attention dilution across many sources or create a dedicated comparison step.
Overall explanation
Prompt chaining is appropriate when a workflow has predictable stages that benefit from focused attention. In this case, the reliable structure is to analyze each source or small source group first, producing structured findings with caveats and provenance, then run a separate cross-source integration pass before report generation.

The architectural principle is to avoid forcing one model call to juggle too many competing responsibilities at once. A focused local pass improves extraction quality, while the integration pass explicitly compares evidence, identifies contradictions, and prepares a coherent synthesis for the report agent.

Simply asking the synthesis agent to be more careful leaves the overloaded design unchanged. Random parallel partitioning can improve throughput, but concatenating summaries without an integration step risks fluent but inconsistent reporting. Using a fixed iteration limit or citation-count target is also unreliable because those signals do not measure whether the system handled methodological conflicts or caveats correctly.

Question 5
Incorrect
Scenario: Developer Productivity with Claude You are building developer productivity tools using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent helps engineers explore unfamiliar codebases, understand legacy systems, generate boilerplate code, and automate repetitive tasks. It uses built-in tools (Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob) and integrates with MCP servers. Your team added a CI step that reviews code produced by an internal Claude-powered scaffolding workflow. The review job currently resumes the same named Claude session that generated the branch, then asks it to critique the resulting pull request. Human reviewers report that the automated review misses subtle design issues and often defends choices made during generation. What change would most improve review quality?
Correct answer
Run the review in a separate Claude Code invocation with the PR diff, repository context, and review criteria only.
Explanation
A separate review invocation avoids carrying over the reasoning and assumptions from the code generation session. This gives the reviewer a cleaner perspective focused on the actual diff, repository standards, and stated review criteria.
Ask the generating session to perform three consecutive review passes and report only issues found twice.
Explanation
Repeating review passes in the same session does not create independent judgment because the same context and assumptions remain. Requiring issues to appear twice can suppress valid findings, especially subtle ones that may be detected inconsistently.
Resume the generation session after tests complete, then provide failing logs before requesting final review feedback.
Explanation
Providing test logs is useful for debugging, but it does not address the core review-quality problem caused by context reuse. This approach turns the review into an extension of implementation rather than an independent critique of the pull request.
Your answer is incorrect
Keep the existing session but add instructions requiring Claude to challenge its prior assumptions before approving changes.
Explanation
This still relies on the same conversation context that produced the implementation, so the prior reasoning remains present. Prompting for skepticism can help somewhat, but it does not remove the bias created by reusing the generation context.
Overall explanation
Independent review context is important when Claude reviews code that was generated by Claude. A session that already contains the implementation reasoning may be less likely to question those decisions, so a separate Claude Code invocation should receive the PR diff, repository context, and explicit review criteria without the generator's prior chain of work.

The underlying principle is session context isolation: generation and review are different roles, and the review role benefits from not inheriting the assumptions, tradeoffs, and justifications from the generation role. This is especially relevant in CI/CD, where automated feedback must be trusted by developers and should not simply validate the implementation path already taken.

Adding skeptical instructions to the same session is weaker because it preserves the original context. Running repeated passes in the same session is also an anti-pattern because it creates apparent rigor without independent judgment, and consensus filtering can hide real but subtle defects. Supplying test logs to the generation session helps with fixing failures, but it does not make the review independent.

Question 6
Incorrect
Scenario: Multi-Agent Research System You are building a multi-agent research system using the Claude Agent SDK. A coordinator agent delegates to specialized subagents: one searches the web, one analyzes documents, one synthesizes findings, and one generates reports. The system researches topics and produces comprehensive, cited reports. In staging, final reports occasionally include polished sections with missing or unverifiable citations. Traces show the coordinator sometimes invokes the report-generation subagent after receiving web-search and document-analysis outputs, while the synthesis subagent is still pending or has returned an error. What change would most effectively prevent these invalid reports?
Your answer is incorrect
Allow report generation to start immediately, then run a final citation scan and discard reports with missing references.
Explanation
Post-hoc scanning may catch some invalid outputs, but it wastes work and does not address the incorrect workflow transition. It also risks missing semantic provenance problems where citations exist but do not support the generated claims.
Strengthen the report-generation subagent prompt to refuse drafting unless it believes synthesis completed and all citations are available.
Explanation
Prompt instructions can improve behavior but do not guarantee compliance when the coordinator invokes the subagent with incomplete inputs. The failure is an orchestration ordering problem, so relying on the report generator to notice missing prerequisites leaves a nonzero failure rate.
Correct answer
Add a coordinator-side prerequisite that blocks report-generation Task calls until synthesis returns a structured citation manifest and success status.
Explanation
This makes the required workflow ordering deterministic rather than relying on model judgment during each run. By blocking the downstream report-generation subagent until the prerequisite artifact exists, the coordinator cannot produce reports from incomplete or failed synthesis results.
Have the coordinator parse synthesis messages for phrases like "complete" or "ready" before starting the report-generation subagent.
Explanation
Parsing natural language completion cues is brittle because wording can vary and may not reliably represent successful completion. The coordinator should use structured status and artifacts, not inferred phrases, to control workflow progression.
Overall explanation
Deterministic workflow enforcement is the right pattern when a downstream step must not run until an upstream step has completed successfully. In this case, report generation depends on a synthesis result that includes citation provenance, so the coordinator should block report-generation Task calls until a structured citation manifest and success status are present.

The underlying principle is to separate workflow control from model-level guidance. Prompts can guide subagent behavior, but they cannot guarantee that a subagent will detect every missing prerequisite after it has already been invoked with incomplete context.

Parsing natural language phrases such as complete or ready is an anti-pattern because it turns workflow state into an unreliable text-classification problem. Post-hoc citation scans are useful as validation, but they should not replace an orchestration gate that prevents invalid work from starting.

Question 7
Correct
Scenario: Developer Productivity with Claude You are building developer productivity tools using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent helps engineers explore unfamiliar codebases, understand legacy systems, generate boilerplate code, and automate repetitive tasks. It uses built-in tools (Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob) and integrates with MCP servers. In your CI pipeline, a Claude Code job proposes unit tests for pull requests touching legacy modules. Developers report that many suggestions are superficial, duplicate scenarios already covered elsewhere, or ignore reusable factories and fixtures described only in scattered onboarding notes. What change would most effectively improve the usefulness of generated tests across the team?
Add a post-processing script that rejects generated tests containing duplicate names or assertions under five lines.
Explanation
A syntactic filter can catch some obvious duplicates, but it cannot reliably evaluate whether a test covers meaningful behavior or reuses the correct fixtures. Arbitrary length-based rejection is an anti-pattern because concise tests can be valuable and long tests can still be redundant.
Move test generation into a personal command so each engineer can tune prompts for their preferred style.
Explanation
Personal commands are user-scoped and will produce inconsistent behavior across the team and CI environment. The problem is shared test quality in an automated workflow, so the guidance should be project-scoped and version-controlled.
Increase the requested number of tests per file so Claude explores more scenarios before selecting final suggestions.
Explanation
Asking for more tests does not teach Claude what the team considers valuable or which fixtures already exist. This often increases low-value output because the model fills the requested volume with redundant or shallow scenarios.
Your answer is correct
Document team testing standards, high-value test criteria, and reusable fixtures in project CLAUDE.md consumed by the CI job.
Explanation
Project-level Claude Code context is the right place for team-wide standards that should influence every CI invocation. Capturing valuable test criteria and available fixtures gives Claude concrete guidance, reducing superficial or duplicate test suggestions without relying on each developer's private preferences.
Overall explanation
Project-scoped context is the appropriate way to make CI-invoked Claude Code follow shared testing expectations. By documenting testing standards, what counts as a valuable test, and available fixtures in CLAUDE.md, every automated invocation receives the same repository-specific guidance.

The underlying principle is that Claude Code performs better when it has concrete project context rather than generic instructions like “write good tests.” Test generation quality depends heavily on knowing existing fixtures, fixture naming conventions, accepted assertion patterns, and which scenarios are already considered valuable.

Requesting more tests is an anti-pattern because it optimizes for volume rather than usefulness. Syntactic filters and arbitrary size rules miss semantic duplication and can reject concise high-quality tests. Personal commands are also a poor fit because CI needs consistent, shared behavior rather than developer-specific prompt variants.

Question 8
Correct
Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. In a compliance review, you find several transcripts where the agent called <code>process_refund</code> immediately after a customer claimed an order was damaged. In those cases, <code>lookup_order</code> later showed the order was past the return window or the refund amount differed from the customer's estimate. The current system prompt says to verify customers and check order eligibility before refunds. What change best reduces this risk?
Add a text parser that permits process_refund only after assistant messages contain verified, eligible, and refund amount.
Explanation
Parsing assistant natural language is a brittle anti-pattern because wording can vary while the underlying state remains incomplete or incorrect. Enforcement should depend on structured tool results and state, not on phrases in generated text.
Your answer is correct
Add a prerequisite gate that rejects process_refund until verified customer, eligible order, and computed refund amount are present in state.
Explanation
This creates a deterministic control point for a workflow ordering requirement that has financial and compliance consequences. The agent can still reason flexibly, but the refund action cannot execute until required facts have been established in system state.
Add few-shot examples where the assistant calls get_customer and lookup_order before refunds, including damaged-order and late-return cases.
Explanation
Few-shot examples can clarify expected patterns, but they do not enforce the sequence at runtime. They are useful for shaping model behavior, not for guaranteeing compliance with required prerequisites.
Strengthen the system prompt to require checking customer identity and order eligibility before any refund-related tool call.
Explanation
This may improve behavior, but it still relies on probabilistic instruction following. The review already shows that prompt guidance is not sufficient for a workflow step where incorrect execution creates financial risk.
Overall explanation
Deterministic workflow enforcement is the right approach when a tool action depends on prior steps, especially for financial operations such as refunds. A prerequisite gate can inspect structured state, such as verified customer identity, order eligibility, and computed refund amount, before allowing process_refund to execute.

The underlying architectural tradeoff is between guidance and enforcement. System prompts and few-shot examples can improve the model's tendency to follow a workflow, but they cannot guarantee ordering when the model is choosing tools autonomously. For business-critical prerequisites, prompt guidance should be backed by programmatic checks.

Using a natural-language parser over assistant text is also unreliable because generated wording is not a source of truth. The safer design is to base decisions on structured tool outputs and explicit state transitions. Learn more about tool orchestration in Tool Use and agent workflow patterns in Agent SDK.

Question 9
Correct
Scenario: Developer Productivity with Claude You are building developer productivity tools using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent helps engineers explore unfamiliar codebases, understand legacy systems, generate boilerplate code, and automate repetitive tasks. It uses built-in tools (Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob) and integrates with MCP servers. An engineer asks the agent to investigate a production stack trace from an unfamiliar legacy service. The trace contains the message "InvalidInventoryTransition" and references a helper named validateTransition, but the repository has hundreds of source files and inconsistent directory naming. What should the agent do first to find the relevant implementation and usage sites efficiently?
Use Read to load the entire module tree upfront, then ask the agent to infer all relevant references.
Explanation
Reading large portions of the repository upfront is a context management anti-pattern. It consumes the context window with irrelevant content and increases the chance that the agent misses the specific implementation details needed for the investigation.
Use Glob to list likely source files by extension, then Read each candidate file until the error appears.
Explanation
Glob is designed for file path pattern matching, not searching inside file contents. Listing likely files by extension still leaves the agent to inspect many candidates manually, which is inefficient in a large legacy repository.
Your answer is correct
Use Grep to search file contents for the error string and function names, then Read the matching files.
Explanation
Grep is the appropriate built-in tool when the goal is finding patterns inside file contents, such as error messages, function names, or imports. Starting with targeted content search narrows the investigation before using Read on relevant files, preserving context and reducing wasted exploration.
Use Bash to run ad hoc recursive shell commands, then paste the raw terminal output into context.
Explanation
Bash can execute shell commands, but it is less targeted than using the built-in search tool designed for code content lookup. Pasting raw recursive command output can flood the context with noisy results instead of guiding the agent toward focused file reads.
Overall explanation
Grep is the right first tool when the agent needs to search file contents for known strings such as error messages, function names, import statements, or identifiers. In practice, this lets the agent quickly identify candidate implementation and usage sites, then use Read only on the files that matter.

The underlying principle is progressive codebase exploration: start with a narrow content search, then read the smallest useful set of files to understand control flow and dependencies. This preserves context window capacity and avoids attention dilution in large repositories.

Glob is useful for matching file paths, such as **/*.test.tsx, but it does not inspect file contents. Loading broad directory trees with Read is an anti-pattern because it adds irrelevant material to context before the agent knows what matters. Using Bash for ad hoc recursive searches can work in some environments, but raw terminal output is often noisy and less controlled than the purpose-built code search tool.

Question 10
Correct
Scenario: Developer Productivity with Claude You are building developer productivity tools using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent helps engineers explore unfamiliar codebases, understand legacy systems, generate boilerplate code, and automate repetitive tasks. It uses built-in tools (Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob) and integrates with MCP servers. An engineer asks the agent to explain how the "user export" capability works in a legacy repository. The final answer confidently covers REST controllers and serializers, but misses scheduled exports, admin-triggered jobs, and CLI invocations. Logs show every subagent completed successfully; their prompts were "inspect export controller," "trace export API request," and "summarize export endpoint tests." What should you change first to improve coverage on similar broad codebase questions?
Run a fixed pipeline that always invokes controller, database, CLI, worker, and test subagents for every codebase query.
Explanation
A fixed pipeline may improve coverage for some cases, but it is inefficient and poorly matched to varied developer questions. The coordinator should choose subagents based on the actual capability being investigated rather than always running every possible path.
Require each subagent to read every file matching export-related terms before returning any findings to the coordinator.
Explanation
This brute-force approach wastes context and increases attention dilution without improving task allocation. It can also bury important findings in verbose output, making downstream synthesis less reliable.
Your answer is correct
Revise coordinator planning to identify plausible entry points, then delegate distinct code areas to subagents before synthesis.
Explanation
The symptoms show that subagents completed their assigned work, but the assignments covered only the HTTP path. Improving the coordinator's initial planning helps ensure broad codebase questions are decomposed across relevant entry points before synthesis begins.
Strengthen the synthesis subagent prompt to infer missing workflows from naming conventions and common framework patterns.
Explanation
This asks the synthesis agent to guess about code paths that were never investigated. Inference from conventions may produce plausible but unsupported explanations, especially in legacy systems where behavior often differs from standard patterns.
Overall explanation
The root issue is the coordinator's task decomposition, not subagent execution. The subagents completed successfully, but all assigned prompts focused on the REST API path, so the final answer missed other relevant workflows such as scheduled jobs, admin actions, and CLI commands.

For broad codebase exploration, the coordinator should first reason about the possible surfaces where a capability may appear, such as controllers, jobs, commands, tests, database models, and integrations. It can then delegate distinct areas to specialized subagents and aggregate their findings into a complete explanation.

Asking synthesis to infer missing workflows is an anti-pattern because it encourages unsupported guesses. Having every subagent read every matching file creates context bloat and attention dilution, while a fixed pipeline wastes work and ignores the need for dynamic routing based on query complexity.

The underlying principle is that a coordinator-subagent architecture depends on the coordinator to preserve coverage and routing discipline. Learn more about agent orchestration patterns in the Agent SDK documentation.

Question 11
Correct
Scenario: Developer Productivity with Claude You are building developer productivity tools using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent helps engineers explore unfamiliar codebases, understand legacy systems, generate boilerplate code, and automate repetitive tasks. It uses built-in tools (Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob) and integrates with MCP servers. A senior engineer asks Claude to replace a legacy permissions layer across API handlers, CLI tools, shared middleware, tests, and documentation. The team has not chosen between adapting existing interfaces or introducing a new authorization boundary, and incorrect sequencing could break unrelated workflows. What should you have Claude do first?
Begin direct execution on the highest-traffic package, then let failing tests reveal additional files that require changes.
Explanation
This is a risky discovery-by-breakage approach. Direct execution is appropriate for simple, well-scoped changes, not for migrations where architectural choices and sequencing must be understood before editing.
Start a fresh session for each package and avoid sharing findings, preventing earlier assumptions from influencing later edits.
Explanation
This fragments the investigation and discards useful cross-package context. For a coordinated migration, Claude needs a shared understanding of dependencies and design decisions rather than isolated edits with no synthesized plan.
Your answer is correct
Use plan mode to explore dependencies, compare viable migration strategies, and produce an implementation plan before modifying files.
Explanation
This task involves broad codebase impact, multiple valid approaches, architectural decisions, and likely multi-file modifications. Plan mode is designed for this kind of upfront exploration and design, reducing the chance of costly rework before edits begin.
Ask Claude to edit every file matching the legacy permission imports, then manually review the diff afterward.
Explanation
This relies on mechanical search-and-replace behavior for a change that requires design judgment. Matching imports does not reveal semantic dependencies, migration order, or whether a new authorization boundary is preferable.
Overall explanation
Plan mode is the appropriate first step when a task involves large-scale changes, multiple plausible approaches, architectural decisions, or coordinated multi-file modifications. In practice, it lets Claude inspect the codebase, identify dependencies, compare strategies, and present a reviewable implementation plan before making changes.

The key tradeoff is between safe upfront design and faster execution. Direct execution works well for simple, well-scoped edits, but using it for a permissions migration risks discovering design conflicts only after files have already been changed.

Mechanical import editing and test-failure-driven discovery are anti-patterns for architectural migrations because they treat a semantic design change like a simple refactor. Isolating each package in separate sessions without shared findings also undermines consistency across the migration.

Question 12
Correct
Scenario: Multi-Agent Research System You are building a multi-agent research system using the Claude Agent SDK. A coordinator agent delegates to specialized subagents: one searches the web, one analyzes documents, one synthesizes findings, and one generates reports. The system researches topics and produces comprehensive, cited reports. In pilot runs on fast-changing market topics, reviewers find final reports often make accurate individual claims but misstate whether evidence is current, peer-reviewed, or based on a small regional sample. When they ask the report generator to add citations, it sometimes cites the correct document but cannot identify the page, publication date, or study basis from earlier handoffs. What change would most effectively improve downstream synthesis reliability?
Your answer is correct
Update each subagent's output contract to attach dates, source locations, and methodological notes to every extracted finding.
Explanation
This preserves the contextual details the synthesis and report agents need to interpret evidence correctly. Attaching dates, source locations, and methodological notes at the finding level prevents critical qualifiers from being lost during handoffs and summarization.
Increase synthesis context by passing full raw transcripts from every source instead of compact summaries between subagents.
Explanation
Passing full transcripts may preserve information, but it increases token usage and can worsen attention dilution in long contexts. The problem is not simply lack of volume, it is that the important qualifiers are not being carried forward in a structured way.
Add a report cleanup pass that infers missing citation details from wording and fills gaps before publishing.
Explanation
Inferring missing citation details is an anti-pattern because it risks fabricating provenance and methodological context. Citation and source details should be preserved from upstream analysis, not reconstructed from report language after the fact.
Sort all source summaries chronologically before synthesis so the newest evidence is more visible in the prompt.
Explanation
Chronological ordering can help with temporal awareness, but it does not preserve page locations, study basis, or methodological limitations for each claim. The synthesis agent still lacks structured metadata needed to qualify and cite findings accurately.
Overall explanation
Correct approach: In a multi-agent research pipeline, each subagent should return structured findings that keep critical context attached to the claim, including publication or collection dates, source locations, and methodological context. This gives downstream synthesis and report-generation agents the evidence needed to distinguish current findings from outdated ones, peer-reviewed studies from commentary, and broad findings from narrow samples.

Underlying principle: Long multi-agent workflows compress information at each handoff, so important qualifiers can disappear unless they are explicitly preserved. Structured per-finding metadata is more reliable than relying on later agents to rediscover or infer missing context from compact summaries.

Why the distractors fail: Passing full transcripts increases context load and can trigger attention problems without ensuring the right details are used. Inferring citation details during a cleanup pass risks hallucinated provenance. Chronological ordering helps only one dimension of the problem and still leaves source locations and methodological notes unavailable.

Question 13
Correct
Scenario: Developer Productivity with Claude You are building developer productivity tools using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent helps engineers explore unfamiliar codebases, understand legacy systems, generate boilerplate code, and automate repetitive tasks. It uses built-in tools (Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob) and integrates with MCP servers. A senior engineer reports that Claude Code consistently follows your team's codebase exploration notes, legacy module warnings, and boilerplate conventions. New engineers who clone the repository see generic behavior instead, and no repository files changed when the senior engineer originally added those notes. What is the most effective way to make this guidance consistent for the team?
Ask each developer to copy the senior engineer’s personal memory file into their home directory before using Claude Code.
Explanation
This keeps the guidance in user-scoped configuration, which is not shared through version control. It creates manual setup drift and makes future updates unreliable across the team.
Paste the conventions into the first prompt of each new session instead of changing repository configuration files.
Explanation
Pasting guidance into each session is manual, easy to forget, and likely to diverge between developers. It also increases repeated prompt overhead without providing a durable shared configuration mechanism.
Create a slash command that reminds Claude to apply the conventions whenever developers remember to invoke it.
Explanation
Slash commands are useful for on-demand workflows, but they do not solve always-loaded project guidance. Relying on developers to remember a command is an anti-pattern when the requirement is consistent default behavior.
Your answer is correct
Move the shared conventions into a project-level CLAUDE.md file and commit it so every clone loads them.
Explanation
Team-wide Claude Code guidance must live in a project-scoped configuration file that is version-controlled with the repository. This addresses the inconsistency because new engineers will receive the same instructions automatically when they clone or pull the project.
Overall explanation
Project-scoped configuration is the right fix when Claude Code behavior must be consistent for everyone working in the same repository. Guidance stored in a project-level CLAUDE.md, such as .claude/CLAUDE.md or a root CLAUDE.md, can be committed and distributed through normal version control workflows.

The underlying principle is scope alignment: personal preferences belong in user-level memory, while team standards and repository-specific context belong in project-level configuration. If guidance was added locally but no repository files changed, the likely issue is that it was stored in a personal location rather than a shared project file.

Copying personal memory files, relying on optional slash commands, or pasting conventions at session start all create process-dependent behavior and configuration drift. These approaches are fragile because they depend on each developer remembering the same manual steps.

Question 14
Correct
Scenario: Multi-Agent Research System You are building a multi-agent research system using the Claude Agent SDK. A coordinator agent delegates to specialized subagents: one searches the web, one analyzes documents, one synthesizes findings, and one generates reports. The system researches topics and produces comprehensive, cited reports. Over the weekend, several source documents were revised, a search index was refreshed, and two previously collected subagent outputs now cite superseded versions. The coordinator still has a saved investigation session containing the earlier web results, document analyses, and synthesis notes. What is the most reliable way to continue the research without contaminating the final report with outdated evidence?
Your answer is correct
Start a fresh session with a structured summary of still-valid findings, then re-run targeted searches and analyses for changed sources.
Explanation
Starting fresh avoids carrying stale tool outputs and outdated subagent observations forward as if they were still authoritative. Injecting a structured summary preserves useful context while forcing updated evidence to be gathered where source validity has changed.
Resume the saved session and cap the coordinator to three additional iterations before generating the updated cited report.
Explanation
An arbitrary iteration cap does not address the stale evidence problem and may prematurely stop needed revalidation work. This is an anti-pattern because loop limits should not substitute for source freshness checks and evidence management.
Resume the saved session with --resume and instruct the coordinator to ignore any results produced before the weekend.
Explanation
This keeps stale tool results in the active context, where they can still influence reasoning despite the instruction to ignore them. Prompt instructions are weaker than removing invalid context when source freshness directly affects report accuracy.
Create fork_session branches from the saved investigation and compare which branch produces the most internally consistent final report.
Explanation
Forking is useful for exploring divergent approaches from a shared valid baseline, not for repairing a baseline polluted by outdated evidence. Internal consistency does not prove that citations and facts reflect the revised source documents.
Overall explanation
Correct approach: When prior tool outputs are stale, the most reliable pattern is to start with a clean context and inject only a structured summary of information that remains valid. This preserves continuity without letting old search results, outdated document analyses, or superseded citations compete with refreshed evidence.

Underlying principle: Session resumption is useful when the prior context is mostly valid, but stale tool results can distort subsequent reasoning because they remain part of the conversation history. A structured summary acts as a controlled handoff: it carries forward durable decisions, open questions, and validated findings while requiring changed sources to be rechecked.

Why the alternatives fail: Simply resuming with --resume and telling the coordinator to ignore old results relies on prompt compliance while leaving invalid evidence in context. Using fork_session explores alternative approaches, but it branches from the same stale baseline. Adding an arbitrary iteration cap is an anti-pattern because it controls runtime rather than evidence quality or freshness.

Question 15
Incorrect
Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. A customer starts a chat with: "I don't want to go through a bot. Put me through to a person about order 8421." The message includes enough details that your normal automation would probably resolve the delayed-shipment issue in one or two tool calls. You are tuning the escalation policy and want to avoid both unnecessary deflection and unnecessary automation. What should the agent do next?
Use sentiment analysis on the message, escalating only when the customer appears highly frustrated or hostile.
Explanation
Sentiment is an unreliable proxy for whether escalation is appropriate. The customer has already made a clear request, so routing should not depend on inferred emotional intensity.
Your answer is incorrect
Acknowledge the request, run lookup_order to confirm eligibility, then offer the replacement before considering escalation.
Explanation
This optimizes for first-contact resolution at the expense of the customer's explicit preference. Even if the case is straightforward, attempting autonomous resolution first can feel like deflection and violates the escalation boundary.
Correct answer
Call escalate_to_human with the order context and brief summary, without attempting autonomous lookup or replacement processing first.
Explanation
An explicit request for a human should be honored without requiring the customer to participate in automated troubleshooting first. A concise handoff preserves context for the human agent while respecting the customer's stated preference.
Ask the customer to explain why human help is needed, then continue autonomously if the reason seems resolvable.
Explanation
Requiring justification adds friction and risks overriding a clear customer preference. The agent can include the customer's stated issue in the handoff without interrogating them or continuing autonomously.
Overall explanation
Explicit customer preference is a hard escalation signal. When a customer directly asks for a human agent, the support agent should use escalate_to_human and provide a concise handoff rather than first attempting tool-based resolution.

The tradeoff is between maximizing first-contact resolution and maintaining trust. If the customer only expresses frustration but does not request a person, it can be appropriate to acknowledge the frustration and offer help for a straightforward issue. When the customer clearly asks for a human, continuing automation becomes a deflection pattern.

Using sentiment as the deciding factor is an anti-pattern because frustration level does not reliably indicate case complexity or customer preference. Asking the customer to justify the request also adds unnecessary friction and can worsen the experience.

Question 16
Correct
Scenario: Multi-Agent Research System You are building a multi-agent research system using the Claude Agent SDK. A coordinator agent delegates to specialized subagents: one searches the web, one analyzes documents, one synthesizes findings, and one generates reports. The system researches topics and produces comprehensive, cited reports. A user requests a report comparing how proposed AI copyright rules affect music licensing, model training data, and independent film production across the same jurisdictions and dates. Logs show the coordinator routes the entire request to one document analysis pass, then asks the report agent to write separate sections. The final report deeply covers licensing, barely addresses training data, and gives recommendations that conflict across sectors. What workflow change would most effectively improve the result?
Process the concerns sequentially from highest commercial value to lowest, finalizing each report section before starting the next concern.
Explanation
Sequential processing may improve focus on the first concern, but it increases the risk that later concerns receive less context or inconsistent assumptions. Finalizing sections before synthesis also makes cross-sector contradictions harder to detect and reconcile.
Your answer is correct
Split the request into distinct concern threads, investigate them in parallel with shared constraints, then synthesize one unified cross-sector report.
Explanation
This approach preserves coverage for each concern while keeping shared constraints consistent across the investigation. Parallel investigation reduces attention dilution, and a unified synthesis step resolves interactions and contradictions before report generation.
Add an instruction that the report agent should mention every requested sector at least once before delivering the final answer.
Explanation
This treats the symptom of missing coverage rather than the workflow problem that caused uneven investigation. Mentioning each sector does not ensure sufficient evidence, consistent assumptions, or reconciliation of conflicting recommendations.
Ask every subagent to independently analyze the full user request, then concatenate their outputs into the final report document.
Explanation
This creates duplicated effort and inconsistent interpretations of the same shared constraints. Concatenating outputs is an anti-pattern because it skips the synthesis step needed to reconcile overlaps, conflicts, and cross-sector implications.
Overall explanation
Correct workflow pattern: Compound requests should be decomposed into distinct concerns that can be investigated with focused attention, while shared constraints such as jurisdictions, dates, source requirements, and definitions are passed into each investigation. The coordinator can then synthesize the findings into a single report that reconciles interactions, conflicts, and dependencies across the concerns.

The underlying architectural principle is to separate focused parallel investigation from unified synthesis. A single broad pass risks attention dilution, while independent full-scope analyses create duplication and inconsistent assumptions. Sequentially finalizing sections can also produce incompatible conclusions because cross-concern relationships are not evaluated until too late.

The reporting-stage instruction is a common anti-pattern: it asks the final writer to cosmetically cover every topic without ensuring that the research workflow gathered enough evidence for each topic. Reliable multi-step workflows assign distinct items, preserve shared context, and require synthesis before final reporting.

Question 17
Correct
Scenario: Structured Data Extraction You are building a structured data extraction system using Claude. The system extracts information from unstructured documents, validates output using JSON schemas, and maintains high accuracy. It must handle edge cases gracefully and integrate with downstream systems. Production review shows inconsistent routing: documents with unreadable required values and unfamiliar layouts sometimes flow into downstream systems, while routine invoices missing optional purchase-order numbers are sent for manual review. The extraction schema already permits nullable fields for data that is absent from the source. What change would most effectively improve routing decisions?
Escalate documents based on frustrated wording, urgent language, or negative sentiment detected in the source text.
Explanation
Sentiment is an unreliable proxy for extraction complexity or downstream risk. Source documents may contain urgent or negative language while still being straightforward to extract accurately.
Your answer is correct
Add explicit human-review criteria with few-shot examples distinguishing absent optional fields, unreadable required fields, and unsupported document types.
Explanation
This directly addresses inconsistent decision boundaries by teaching when the system should proceed versus involve a human reviewer. Few-shot examples are especially useful for ambiguous cases where similar-looking documents require different routing outcomes.
Route documents to reviewers whenever the model reports confidence below a single global threshold after extraction.
Explanation
Self-reported confidence can be poorly calibrated and may not reflect actual extraction risk across document types or fields. A single global threshold also ignores important distinctions, such as optional missing fields versus unreadable required values.
Require retries until all schema fields are populated, then escalate only documents still containing null values.
Explanation
This encourages fabrication when fields are legitimately absent, especially when the schema already permits nullable values. Retrying until nulls disappear confuses missing optional information with extraction failure.
Overall explanation
Explicit routing criteria with targeted few-shot examples improve escalation calibration because they define the operational difference between safe automation and human-review cases. In this scenario, nullable fields already handle legitimately absent optional data, so missing purchase-order numbers should not automatically trigger review.

The underlying principle is to use specific decision boundaries rather than weak proxies. Unreadable required values, unsupported document types, or ambiguous layouts are meaningful review triggers, while absent optional fields can be represented as null and passed downstream if the schema allows it.

Self-reported confidence thresholds and sentiment-based routing are anti-patterns because they do not reliably measure case complexity or extraction risk. Retrying until every field is populated is also dangerous because it pressures the model to invent values instead of preserving uncertainty.

Question 18
Correct
Scenario: Developer Productivity with Claude You are building developer productivity tools using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent helps engineers explore unfamiliar codebases, understand legacy systems, generate boilerplate code, and automate repetitive tasks. It uses built-in tools (Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob) and integrates with MCP servers. Your repository's root CLAUDE.md has grown to 1,200 lines covering testing, API conventions, migration rules, deployment checks, and review norms. Engineers complain that small standards changes cause frequent merge conflicts, and Claude sometimes appears distracted by unrelated guidance. The team wants shared, version-controlled instructions, but needs a more maintainable layout without relying on developers to remember extra steps. What should you do?
Keep one root CLAUDE.md and add stronger section headings telling Claude to consult only relevant parts.
Explanation
Better headings may improve readability, but they do not solve the merge conflict and maintainability problems caused by one large shared file. This is a monolithic-configuration anti-pattern when the team needs modular, topic-specific organization.
Create slash commands for each standards topic and ask engineers to invoke the right command before coding.
Explanation
Slash commands are useful for on-demand workflows, not for always-available coding standards that should apply consistently. Requiring engineers to remember manual command invocation makes compliance unreliable and fails the requirement for automatic shared guidance.
Your answer is correct
Split the guidance into focused topic files under .claude/rules/, such as testing.md, api-conventions.md, and deployment.md.
Explanation
Organizing topic-specific guidance in .claude/rules/ preserves shared, repository-level configuration while avoiding a single oversized CLAUDE.md file. This directly addresses maintainability and review concerns without requiring developers to manually invoke commands or copy personal settings.
Move the shared standards into ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md so each engineer loads the same instructions outside repository files.
Explanation
User-level CLAUDE.md files are personal configuration and are not shared through the repository. This would create inconsistent behavior across engineers unless everyone manually maintained identical local files, which is exactly the kind of drift team configuration should avoid.
Overall explanation
Modular Claude Code configuration is the right fit when a shared CLAUDE.md has become too large to maintain effectively. Splitting guidance into topic-specific files under .claude/rules/ keeps standards version-controlled while reducing the operational burden of editing and reviewing one monolithic instruction file.

The underlying principle is to keep persistent project context organized by concern. Testing, API conventions, deployment rules, and review norms can evolve independently, making changes easier to review and reducing accidental conflicts between unrelated guidance areas.

Moving instructions into ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md breaks team sharing because that file is scoped to one user. Keeping everything in one root file with stronger headings preserves the monolith and relies on attention management rather than configuration structure. Slash commands are the wrong abstraction because they require manual invocation and are better suited to task-specific workflows, not baseline project standards.

Question 19
Correct
Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. During billing disputes, the agent creates condensed case notes before responding or escalating. Human reviewers report that notes sometimes say things like "refund approved" or "customer was promised free return shipping," but they cannot tell whether each claim came from the customer, an order record, a policy document, or the agent's inference. In several escalations, customer allegations were treated as verified backend facts. What change would most effectively reduce this reliability risk?
Store complete raw transcripts and tool outputs only, relying on human reviewers to reconstruct sources when disputes arise.
Explanation
Raw records are useful for auditability, but they do not solve the operational handoff problem by themselves. Reviewers still need claim-level provenance to understand which statements support each conclusion without manually reconstructing the entire case.
Compress each case into a shorter narrative summary and instruct reviewers to ask follow-up questions when provenance seems unclear.
Explanation
Shorter narrative summaries make the core problem worse because they remove source boundaries and context. Asking reviewers to investigate later shifts the burden downstream instead of preserving provenance when the information is transformed.
Your answer is correct
Require summaries and handoffs to carry structured claim-source mappings with source type, excerpt or tool field, timestamp, and verification status.
Explanation
This preserves provenance for each material claim as information moves through summarization, response generation, and escalation. It lets the agent and human reviewers distinguish verified backend facts from customer statements, policy text, and model inferences.
Ask the agent to include only high-confidence claims in final responses, omitting uncertain details from summaries and escalations.
Explanation
Self-assessed confidence is not a reliable substitute for source attribution. Omitting uncertain details can hide important ambiguity from human reviewers and may remove exactly the information needed to resolve the dispute safely.
Overall explanation
Correct approach: In multi-source support workflows, condensed summaries must preserve claim-source mappings so every material statement remains tied to where it came from. Including the source type, relevant excerpt or tool field, timestamp, and verification status helps distinguish customer assertions, backend records, policy text, and agent conclusions.

Underlying principle: Summarization is lossy. When case notes compress a long interaction without structured provenance, source attribution can disappear, and downstream agents or humans may accidentally treat allegations as verified facts.

Why the alternatives fail: Shorter narrative summaries intensify provenance loss. Confidence filtering is an anti-pattern because model confidence does not prove factual grounding and can hide uncertainty. Keeping only raw transcripts supports audits, but it forces reviewers to reconstruct evidence manually instead of preserving usable provenance through the workflow.

Question 20
Correct
Scenario: Developer Productivity with Claude You are building developer productivity tools using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent helps engineers explore unfamiliar codebases, understand legacy systems, generate boilerplate code, and automate repetitive tasks. It uses built-in tools (Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob) and integrates with MCP servers. During a legacy billing-module analysis, a coordinator launches separate subagents to trace API handlers, database writes, and scheduled jobs. Each subagent returns useful narrative findings, but the final architecture brief often attaches claims to the wrong file or omits the line ranges engineers need for verification. What change best improves handoff reliability between the subagents and the final synthesizer?
Your answer is correct
Require each subagent to return structured handoff records separating findings, file paths, symbols, line ranges, and evidence snippets.
Explanation
Structured handoff records preserve attribution by keeping the claim separate from the metadata needed to verify it. This lets the final synthesizer combine findings without guessing which file, symbol, or line range supports each claim.
Apply regex parsing to subagent prose summaries, extracting anything that resembles a path, symbol, or citation.
Explanation
Parsing natural language summaries with regex is brittle because prose does not guarantee stable structure or complete metadata. This anti-pattern can extract plausible-looking paths while missing the actual relationship between a claim and its evidence.
Add instructions asking the synthesizer to reconstruct file locations and line numbers from the subagents' narrative summaries.
Explanation
This relies on the synthesizer inferring provenance after it has already been compressed or omitted from the handoff. If line ranges or file associations are ambiguous in the narrative, stronger synthesis instructions cannot reliably recover them.
Have the coordinator concatenate complete subagent transcripts so the synthesizer can search them for relevant provenance details.
Explanation
Passing full transcripts increases context usage and can bury important evidence in verbose intermediate reasoning. It may improve recall in some cases, but it does not create a reliable claim-to-source mapping for downstream synthesis.
Overall explanation
Structured context passing is the reliable pattern when a coordinator hands subagent findings to a downstream synthesizer. Each finding should travel with explicit metadata such as file_path, symbol, line_range, and an evidence excerpt, so the synthesizer can preserve attribution while merging results.

The underlying principle is that subagents have isolated context and downstream agents should not be expected to infer provenance from compressed prose. Structured handoffs reduce ambiguity, improve verification by engineers, and make final reports easier to audit.

Asking the synthesizer to reconstruct missing file references is unreliable because lost metadata cannot be recovered deterministically. Concatenating full transcripts wastes context and increases lost-in-the-middle risk, while regex parsing prose is a brittle anti-pattern that confuses surface patterns with actual claim-source relationships.

Question 21
Correct
Scenario: Structured Data Extraction You are building a structured data extraction system using Claude. The system extracts information from unstructured documents, validates output using JSON schemas, and maintains high accuracy. It must handle edge cases gracefully and integrate with downstream systems. Your invoice extractor currently asks Claude to "return valid JSON" with fields for vendor, invoice_date, line_items, and total_amount. In production, a small but persistent share of responses include markdown fences, explanatory text, or malformed commas, causing downstream parsers to reject otherwise correct extractions. What change would most effectively improve structured output reliability?
Use assistant prefill with an opening brace and stop sequences, then parse the generated text as JSON.
Explanation
Prefill and stop sequences can steer text generation toward a desired format, but they still produce text that must be parsed. This approach is less reliable than structured tool use because malformed JSON or missing schema fields can still occur.
Keep requesting JSON only, then strip markdown fences and trailing prose with regular expressions before parsing.
Explanation
Regex cleanup is an anti-pattern because it treats symptoms after unreliable text generation has already occurred. It can miss edge cases, accidentally alter valid values, and leaves the system dependent on brittle post-processing rather than structured generation.
Add stronger prompt wording that forbids explanations, examples, markdown, comments, and any non-JSON characters in every response.
Explanation
Stronger prompt instructions may reduce formatting issues, but they do not guarantee valid JSON syntax or schema compliance. The observed production failures show that prose-only constraints are not sufficient for a downstream system requiring reliable machine parsing.
Your answer is correct
Define an extraction tool with a JSON schema for target fields, then consume the structured tool_use input directly.
Explanation
Tool use with a JSON schema is the most reliable way to obtain schema-compliant structured output from Claude. Instead of parsing generated text, the application reads the structured input from the tool_use block, eliminating common JSON syntax failures like markdown fences or trailing commentary.
Overall explanation
Structured output reliability is highest when the application uses Claude's tool use mechanism with a JSON schema representing the desired extraction fields. The model emits a tool_use block whose input conforms to the declared schema, so the application consumes structured arguments rather than scraping JSON from natural language text.

The underlying principle is to avoid treating machine-readable output as ordinary prose. Prompt-only instructions, assistant prefill, and stop sequences can improve formatting, but they still rely on text generation and parsing. For production extraction pipelines, tool use with schemas directly addresses JSON syntax failures such as markdown fences, extra commentary, and malformed delimiters.

Regex cleanup is especially brittle because it creates an ad hoc repair layer that can silently corrupt data or fail on new formatting variants. Stronger wording is also insufficient when downstream systems require consistent parseability rather than best-effort compliance.

Question 22
Correct
Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. Production logs show misdirected refunds and privacy disclosures when users provide common names and partial addresses. In these cases, get_customer returns several plausible profiles, and the agent chooses one using recent order activity or name similarity. What change best improves reliability without unnecessarily routing routine cases to humans?
Your answer is correct
Treat multiple customer matches as unresolved identity and request a disambiguating identifier before any order or refund operations.
Explanation
Multiple plausible customer records represent an ambiguity that the agent cannot safely resolve from heuristics alone. Requesting a disambiguating identifier, such as an email address, order number, or phone suffix, prevents account mixups while still allowing the agent to resolve the case autonomously once identity is clear.
Rank matching customers by recent activity and continue with the highest ranked profile when confidence exceeds a threshold.
Explanation
This relies on heuristic selection, which is unsafe when several customer records are plausible. A confidence threshold does not create reliable identity verification and can still lead to privacy disclosures or incorrect refunds.
Call lookup_order for each matching customer profile, then select the account whose order details best match the message.
Explanation
Looking up orders across multiple plausible profiles can expose unrelated customer information to the model and does not solve identity ambiguity. Selecting the best match from order details is still a heuristic choice rather than a reliable clarification process.
Escalate every request with duplicate customer records to a human agent before performing any lookup_order calls.
Explanation
Escalating every duplicate-match case would reduce automation unnecessarily, since many customers can provide additional identifiers in the conversation. Human escalation should be reserved for explicit requests, policy gaps, or cases where meaningful progress cannot be made.
Overall explanation
Correct ambiguity handling treats multiple plausible customer records as an unresolved identity problem, not as a ranking problem. The agent should ask the customer for a disambiguating identifier before accessing order details or taking account actions, which protects privacy and reduces incorrect refunds while preserving first-contact resolution when the customer can clarify.

The underlying reliability principle is to distinguish recoverable ambiguity from cases requiring escalation. Duplicate matches are often recoverable through clarification, so immediate human escalation lowers automation without being necessary. Heuristic selection based on recency, similarity, or self-reported confidence is an anti-pattern because it can make a wrong account look deceptively likely.

Calling downstream tools for every possible match also increases privacy risk and can contaminate the conversation with unrelated customer data. A safer workflow limits sensitive operations until identity is unique enough to proceed, then continues with the normal resolution path.

Question 23
Correct
Scenario: Developer Productivity with Claude You are building developer productivity tools using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent helps engineers explore unfamiliar codebases, understand legacy systems, generate boilerplate code, and automate repetitive tasks. It uses built-in tools (Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob) and integrates with MCP servers. A team asks the agent to update every test fixture file ending in <code>.fixture.json</code> across a monorepo before reading only those files. In trials, the agent searches for the word "fixture" in file contents, producing noisy matches from comments and missing fixture files with sparse content. Which tool-use strategy should you adopt?
Your answer is correct
Use Glob with patterns like <code>**/*.fixture.json</code> to enumerate matching paths, then Read only the files that require inspection.
Explanation
Glob is the appropriate built-in tool when the selection criterion is based on file names, extensions, or path patterns. It returns matching paths directly, reducing noise and allowing the agent to Read only the relevant files.
Use Read on all files under likely folders first, then recursively inspect contents until every fixture candidate is discovered.
Explanation
Reading broad file contents before narrowing by path wastes context and increases the chance of missing files outside guessed folders. It reverses the efficient sequence: first identify matching paths, then read only what is needed.
Use Grep for the word fixture across the repository, then ask Claude to infer which results are fixture files.
Explanation
Grep searches file contents, so it is poorly matched to a task defined by file names and extensions. This approach creates false positives from comments or strings and can miss valid files that do not contain the searched word.
Use Bash to run find and ls pipelines, then paste the complete directory listing into the conversation.
Explanation
Bash can sometimes solve path discovery tasks, but using shell pipelines and dumping full listings adds unnecessary complexity and context noise. The built-in path matching tool is more targeted and avoids making the model sift through irrelevant output.
Overall explanation
Glob is the right tool for path-based discovery. When the task is to find files by name, extension, or path pattern, Glob directly returns matching file paths, such as **/*.fixture.json. After that, the agent can use Read selectively on only the files it needs to inspect or modify.

Grep solves a different problem. Grep is designed for content search, such as finding function names, error messages, or imports inside files. Using content search to discover files by filename is an anti-pattern because it creates noisy matches and misses valid files whose contents do not include the chosen keyword.

Context efficiency matters. Shelling out through Bash or reading large sets of files can work in narrow cases, but those approaches often add irrelevant output and consume context unnecessarily. A strong tool selection strategy narrows the search space first, then reads or edits only the matched files.

Question 24
Correct
Scenario: Structured Data Extraction You are building a structured data extraction system using Claude. The system extracts information from unstructured documents, validates output using JSON schemas, and maintains high accuracy. It must handle edge cases gracefully and integrate with downstream systems. Reviewers are dismissing many extraction warnings after checking the source documents. Your logs capture the final JSON output, confidence score, document type, and reviewer disposition, but your team cannot tell whether false positives cluster around handwritten totals, scanned tables, ambiguous dates, or other recurring source patterns. What change would best support systematic improvement of the extraction workflow?
Retry every dismissed extraction with the reviewer decision appended, then accept the second extraction when confidence increases.
Explanation
Retrying dismissed findings treats reviewer feedback as a one-off correction rather than evidence for systematic improvement. Increased confidence does not prove correctness, and automatic acceptance can reinforce the same false-positive behavior.
Ask reviewers to enter free-text explanations for every dismissal, then manually read comments during quarterly audits.
Explanation
Free-text comments can contain useful details, but they are difficult to aggregate reliably at scale. Manual quarterly review delays feedback and makes it harder to detect recurring false-positive patterns quickly.
Raise the minimum confidence threshold for all extraction warnings until reviewer dismissal rates fall below the target.
Explanation
A global threshold may reduce visible false positives, but it does not explain which source constructs are causing them. It can also suppress valid findings in categories that were already performing well.
Your answer is correct
Add a detected_pattern field to each structured finding, then analyze dismissal rates by pattern during feedback review.
Explanation
A structured pattern field preserves the specific source construct or extraction trigger behind each finding. When reviewers dismiss findings, the team can aggregate by pattern and identify which prompts, schemas, or validations need improvement.
Overall explanation
Structured feedback signals make extraction quality improvements measurable. Adding a detected_pattern field to each structured finding lets the system connect reviewer dismissals to the underlying source construct, such as handwritten totals, scanned tables, or ambiguous date formats.

The architectural principle is to collect machine-analyzable metadata at the moment a finding is produced, rather than relying only on final outputs or aggregate confidence scores. This supports targeted prompt updates, schema adjustments, few-shot examples, or validation rule changes for the patterns that actually drive false positives.

Blind retries are an anti-pattern when the issue is systematic false positives, because they can repeat the same mistake without revealing the cause. Global confidence thresholds hide the problem and may reduce recall in well-performing segments. Free-text reviewer notes are useful as supplemental context, but they are too unstructured and slow to serve as the primary feedback loop.

Question 25
Correct
Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. During evaluation, the coordinator first verifies the customer and retrieves two recent orders, then delegates a billing-dispute investigation. The delegated investigator often asks for the order status again or analyzes the wrong order when the customer mentioned several purchases. You want the coordinator to preserve accuracy without giving the investigator all support tools. What should you change?
Rely on the parent conversation history because Task-spawned investigators can inspect earlier tool results when needed.
Explanation
This assumes context inheritance that subagents do not have. If the investigator is invoked without the relevant customer and order facts in its prompt, it may ask redundant questions, analyze the wrong entity, or produce incomplete results.
Your answer is correct
Include verified customer identity, relevant order records, prior findings, and exact investigation goal in each subagent prompt.
Explanation
Subagents do not automatically receive the coordinator's conversation history or prior tool results. Providing the verified identity, relevant order data, prior findings, and task goal directly in each invocation gives the investigator the context needed to reason accurately without expanding its tool access.
Update coordinator instructions to tell subagents they should remember all facts discovered earlier in the case.
Explanation
Prompting subagents to remember facts they were never given cannot make missing context available. This is an anti-pattern because it relies on nonexistent shared memory rather than passing the needed state explicitly at invocation time.
Have the investigator rerun get_customer and lookup_order for every dispute before assessing refund eligibility or billing adjustments.
Explanation
Giving the subagent backend lookup tools can duplicate work, increase latency, and broaden tool access beyond its investigative role. It also does not solve the core handoff problem when prior coordinator findings, customer statements, and selected order context must be preserved.
Overall explanation
Correct approach: When a coordinator delegates to a subagent, it should provide the relevant case state directly in the subagent invocation. In this situation, the billing investigator needs the verified customer identity, the specific order records, prior tool findings, and the precise investigation goal so it can reason over the correct case without requiring broad backend access.

Underlying principle: Subagents operate with isolated context. They do not automatically inherit the coordinator's conversation history, prior MCP tool results, or hidden memory between invocations, so reliable orchestration requires explicit context passing.

Why the distractors fail: Relying on parent conversation history or telling subagents to remember earlier facts assumes shared context that is not available. Having every subagent rerun lookup tools may appear to recover missing information, but it increases latency, duplicates work, expands tool access, and can still omit coordinator-specific findings or customer statements.

Question 26
Correct
Scenario: Multi-Agent Research System You are building a multi-agent research system using the Claude Agent SDK. A coordinator agent delegates to specialized subagents: one searches the web, one analyzes documents, one synthesizes findings, and one generates reports. The system researches topics and produces comprehensive, cited reports. After a pilot, the system assigns high confidence to most report claims and the team wants to auto-publish those claims. Later customer audits find citation mismatches concentrated in regulatory topics and newly added source types, even though overall quality dashboards remain strong. What review strategy should you implement before further reducing reviewer coverage?
Compute one aggregate accuracy metric from accepted reports, then reduce review once the overall rate exceeds the target.
Explanation
Aggregate accuracy can hide poor performance on narrower document types, topics, fields, or source categories. The observed failures are segment-specific, so a single overall metric is not sufficient for safe review reduction.
Your answer is correct
Randomly sample high-confidence claims across topic, source type, and report section, then track errors and new patterns by stratum.
Explanation
High-confidence outputs still need ongoing review because confidence can be miscalibrated on specific segments. Stratified random sampling measures hidden error rates and helps detect novel failure patterns without requiring review of every claim.
Auto-publish all high-confidence reports immediately, then investigate only customer-reported defects to minimize reviewer workload.
Explanation
This is a reactive anti-pattern because defects are discovered only after users are affected. Customer-reported issues are also biased and incomplete, so they cannot reliably measure true error rates.
Review only claims with low confidence scores, since high-confidence findings should be excluded from routine reviewer queues.
Explanation
This assumes the confidence signal is already reliable across all segments, which the audits contradict. Reviewing only low-confidence claims misses overconfident errors in specific topics or source types.
Overall explanation
Stratified random sampling is the appropriate review strategy when high-confidence outputs may still contain hidden, segment-specific errors. By sampling high-confidence claims across meaningful strata such as topic, source type, and report section, the team can estimate real error rates and detect emerging failure patterns without manually reviewing every output.

The underlying reliability principle is that confidence scores are useful only after they are monitored and calibrated against real outcomes. In multi-agent research systems, errors can cluster in particular source categories or report sections, so review design must reveal those clusters rather than average them away.

Reviewing only low-confidence outputs treats model confidence as perfectly calibrated, which is unsafe. Auto-publishing everything and waiting for customer complaints is reactive and biased, while relying on one aggregate metric can mask serious performance gaps in specialized segments.

Question 27
Correct
Scenario: Structured Data Extraction You are building a structured data extraction system using Claude. The system extracts information from unstructured documents, validates output using JSON schemas, and maintains high accuracy. It must handle edge cases gracefully and integrate with downstream systems. Your product has two document queues: customer onboarding forms that must populate an eligibility screen while an operations specialist is waiting, and 40,000 archived contracts used for a dashboard due next week. Finance asks whether the lower-cost processing path should replace the current real-time calls for both queues. What should you recommend?
Move both queues to the Message Batches API, polling frequently so urgent onboarding jobs usually finish quickly.
Explanation
Frequent polling does not change the Message Batches API latency characteristics or create a guaranteed completion time. This is an anti-pattern for blocking workflows because operations specialists could be stuck waiting for jobs that may take much longer than expected.
Keep both queues on synchronous calls, since batch responses cannot be reliably matched back to submitted documents.
Explanation
This rejects a good fit for the archived contracts based on an incorrect assumption. Batch requests support correlating responses to submissions using custom_id, so asynchronous processing can still integrate cleanly with downstream systems.
Your answer is correct
Keep synchronous calls for onboarding forms, and use the Message Batches API for historical contracts with latency-tolerant processing.
Explanation
This matches the API approach to each workflow's latency requirement. Blocking onboarding screens need predictable interactive completion, while archived contract analysis can tolerate the Message Batches API processing window and benefit from lower cost.
Route onboarding forms to batches first, then fall back to synchronous calls whenever pending jobs exceed a threshold.
Explanation
This adds complexity without solving the core latency problem for the first onboarding users placed into the batch. A fallback threshold cannot guarantee timely completion for blocking work, and it may create duplicate processing and reconciliation issues.
Overall explanation
Match processing mode to latency requirements. The onboarding queue is blocking a human workflow, so it needs synchronous calls with predictable request completion. The archived contract queue is latency-tolerant, so it is a strong fit for the Message Batches API, which can reduce cost for non-urgent processing.

Batch processing tradeoff: message batches are designed for asynchronous workloads and may take up to 24 hours, so polling more often does not make them appropriate for interactive or blocking workflows. A threshold-based fallback also fails because it still sends urgent items into a path without a latency guarantee before deciding to recover.

Integration reliability: avoiding batches entirely because results cannot be matched is based on a false premise. Batch requests include custom_id values specifically so systems can correlate each result with the originating document and resubmit or reconcile work reliably.

Question 28
Correct
Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. Production logs show several distinct backend problems all being returned to the agent as the same text: "Operation failed." Examples include an invalid order ID, a temporary billing service timeout, an expired permission token, and a refund blocked by policy. The agent wastes turns retrying non-retryable failures, asks customers to re-enter valid information after timeouts, and escalates cases it could have resolved. What change would most directly improve recovery behavior?
Retry every failed tool call twice before responding, then escalate if the same MCP tool still reports failure.
Explanation
Blanket retries waste time on non-retryable failures such as invalid input, permission denial, or policy violations. This approach may help occasional transient failures, but it still prevents the agent from tailoring responses to the actual failure type.
Keep a single generic failure message, but instruct the agent to infer retryability from surrounding conversation and customer urgency.
Explanation
This keeps the root cause intact: the tool result still does not communicate what actually failed. Asking the model to infer retryability from conversational context is unreliable because customer urgency does not indicate whether a backend error is transient, validation-related, permission-related, or policy-related.
Your answer is correct
Return structured MCP errors with categories, retryability, and user-safe details so the agent can choose recovery, clarification, or escalation.
Explanation
Uniform failure text hides the information the agent needs to decide what to do next. Structured error metadata lets the agent distinguish retryable outages, invalid inputs, permission problems, and business rule blocks, enabling appropriate local recovery before escalation.
Map failures to customer sentiment levels, escalating angry customers first and retrying only when the conversation remains neutral.
Explanation
Sentiment is not a reliable proxy for technical recoverability or business policy status. This anti-pattern can escalate solvable cases from frustrated customers while mishandling calm customers whose requests require permission checks or policy explanations.
Overall explanation
Structured tool errors give the agent the missing decision context needed for reliable recovery. Instead of returning only "Operation failed", MCP tools should communicate whether the failure is transient, validation-related, permission-related, or business-rule-related, along with whether it is retryable and a safe explanation the agent can use with the customer.

The underlying principle is that agents can only make good recovery decisions when tool outputs preserve operational meaning. A timeout might justify a retry, an invalid order ID should trigger clarification, a permission failure may require reauthentication or escalation, and a policy violation should be explained without repeated attempts.

Generic errors force the model to guess, while blanket retries create wasted tool calls and poor customer experience. Sentiment-based routing is also an anti-pattern because customer emotion does not reveal whether the tool failure is recoverable, non-retryable, or policy-bound.

Question 29
Correct
Scenario: Developer Productivity with Claude You are building developer productivity tools using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent helps engineers explore unfamiliar codebases, understand legacy systems, generate boilerplate code, and automate repetitive tasks. It uses built-in tools (Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob) and integrates with MCP servers. A team has built a Claude-powered helper that updates legacy configuration files to a new format. Initial generations look reasonable in code review, but repeated runs keep breaking different corner cases: missing optional sections, duplicate keys, and large files with thousands of entries. Developers have been sending follow-up prompts like "fix the migration bugs" and receiving inconsistent improvements. What refinement approach should they use next?
Remove the most difficult corner-case checks temporarily so Claude can stabilize the happy-path migration behavior first.
Explanation
Removing difficult checks hides the exact cases that need refinement and creates a false sense of progress. The stated problem involves important corner cases, so the workflow should preserve those tests and use them as guidance.
Your answer is correct
Share the failing test names, inputs, expected versus actual outputs, and stack traces, then iterate on minimal fixes.
Explanation
This turns vague refinement into a concrete feedback loop grounded in observable failures. By giving Claude specific failing cases and expected behavior, the team can progressively improve the migration helper while avoiding unrelated changes.
Ask Claude to reread the entire legacy codebase and rewrite the migration helper from scratch after each failed run.
Explanation
Restarting from scratch discards useful progress and increases the chance of introducing new regressions. It also expands context unnecessarily instead of focusing the refinement loop on the specific failing behaviors.
Tell Claude the output is still wrong, request a more careful implementation, and continue until reviewers approve it.
Explanation
This is an anti-pattern because it relies on vague qualitative feedback rather than concrete failure signals. Claude may improve some behavior, but the team has no systematic way to verify edge cases or prevent regressions.
Overall explanation
Test-driven iteration works best when Claude receives concrete, reproducible feedback: failing test names, representative inputs, expected outputs, actual outputs, and relevant stack traces. This gives the model a precise target for the next revision and helps developers converge on correct behavior without broad, unrelated rewrites.

The underlying principle is that iterative refinement should be anchored in objective signals, not subjective prompts like "be more careful" or repeated code review impressions. For migration and automation tools, tests should cover expected behavior, edge cases, and scale-related requirements, then each refinement cycle should use the failures to guide the next change.

Rewriting from scratch after each failure wastes accumulated progress and increases regression risk. Vague feedback is an anti-pattern because it does not identify which behavior is wrong or how success will be measured. Removing hard tests is also counterproductive because it suppresses the evidence needed to improve the system.

Question 30
Correct
Scenario: Structured Data Extraction You are building a structured data extraction system using Claude. The system extracts information from unstructured documents, validates output using JSON schemas, and maintains high accuracy. It must handle edge cases gracefully and integrate with downstream systems. Your extraction pipeline uses tool use with a strict schema, so outputs are syntactically valid. However, downstream semantic validators reject some invoices because the extracted line-item totals do not match the stated invoice total, and because a due date was placed in the invoice_date field. The current retry simply sends the document again with "fix the extraction," and the same fields often remain wrong. What change would most effectively improve recoverable correction quality?
Your answer is correct
Send a follow-up request containing the document, failed extraction, and exact validation errors for targeted self-correction.
Explanation
This gives Claude the necessary context to understand both what it extracted and exactly why validation failed. Specific validation feedback helps guide correction of recoverable semantic errors, such as swapped fields or inconsistent totals, without starting from an ambiguous blank slate.
Ask Claude to provide a confidence score for each field and retry only fields below a chosen threshold.
Explanation
Self-reported confidence is not a reliable substitute for concrete validation errors. A field can be confidently wrong, and confidence thresholds do not explain that totals failed arithmetic checks or dates were assigned to the wrong field.
Loosen the downstream validators so line-item total mismatches and date-field swaps become warnings instead of failures.
Explanation
This hides quality problems rather than correcting them. Semantic validation exists to protect downstream systems from plausible but incorrect structured data, so weakening it undermines reliability.
Retry the original extraction prompt with a lower temperature and discard the failed output before revalidating.
Explanation
Lower temperature may reduce variation, but it does not tell Claude what was wrong with the prior extraction. Discarding the failed output removes useful context about which fields failed validation and why.
Overall explanation
Targeted retry feedback works because the model receives the original source, the prior structured output, and the validator's specific objections. This allows Claude to focus on correcting recoverable semantic problems, such as totals that fail arithmetic checks or dates placed in the wrong field, rather than repeating the same extraction from an underspecified prompt.

The underlying principle is that strict schemas prevent many syntax and shape errors, but they do not guarantee semantic correctness. Validation and retry loops should turn validator failures into actionable feedback for the next model call, especially when the needed information is present in the document.

Simply rerunning the prompt, changing temperature, or relying on confidence scores are weaker approaches because they do not communicate the concrete failure condition. Loosening validators is an anti-pattern because it lets bad data reach downstream systems instead of improving extraction quality.

Question 31
Correct
Scenario: Structured Data Extraction You are building a structured data extraction system using Claude. The system extracts information from unstructured documents, validates output using JSON schemas, and maintains high accuracy. It must handle edge cases gracefully and integrate with downstream systems. Your QA prompt reviews a 90-page vendor onboarding packet and its extracted records in one call. It catches detailed field errors in the first few forms, but misses mismatched tax IDs in middle attachments and contradicts itself about required signatures. Which review architecture would best improve reliability?
Ask the same extraction instance to critique its own output using extended thinking before returning final records.
Explanation
Self-review in the same session is weaker because the model retains the reasoning context that produced the original extraction. Extended thinking can help with difficult reasoning, but it does not provide the independence or scope separation needed to catch attention-related misses.
Your answer is correct
Run focused review passes on each packet section, then run a separate consistency pass across cross-section fields.
Explanation
This reduces attention dilution by giving each local review a narrower scope, which improves coverage of section-specific extraction errors. The separate consistency pass then focuses on relationships across sections, such as matching tax IDs and signature requirements, without competing with local field checks.
Run three full-packet reviews and accept only issues reported by at least two reviewers.
Explanation
Majority voting over full-packet reviews can suppress real issues that only one pass catches, especially intermittent misses caused by attention limits. It also repeats the same broad-review problem rather than decomposing the task into more reliable focused passes.
Increase max_tokens and add stronger instructions to be exhaustive while reviewing the entire packet once.
Explanation
Increasing output length does not solve attention dilution across a large input. Stronger instructions may improve effort, but a single broad pass still forces the model to balance local field checks and cross-section consistency at the same time.
Overall explanation
Focused multi-pass review works because it separates local validation from global consistency analysis. A section-level pass can inspect each form or attachment deeply, while a later cross-section pass can compare fields such as tax IDs, addresses, signatories, and dates across the entire packet.

The underlying tradeoff is scope versus attention quality. Large, mixed-objective reviews often produce uneven coverage, especially when important evidence appears in the middle of long inputs. Splitting the work into narrower passes gives Claude a clearer objective for each call and reduces contradictory findings.

Self-review by the same instance is limited because the model may preserve assumptions from its original extraction. Increasing max_tokens affects available response length, not whether the model attends evenly to every part of a long packet. Majority voting across broad reviews is also an anti-pattern when it filters out valid findings that appear inconsistently rather than fixing the review architecture.

Question 32
Incorrect
Scenario: Developer Productivity with Claude You are building developer productivity tools using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent helps engineers explore unfamiliar codebases, understand legacy systems, generate boilerplate code, and automate repetitive tasks. It uses built-in tools (Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob) and integrates with MCP servers. Your codebase migration assistant has access to tools for repository metadata extraction, dependency graph analysis, and migration plan generation. Evaluation runs show it sometimes begins dependency analysis or plan generation before collecting canonical package manager and framework versions, producing plans with incorrect assumptions. What change would most reliably enforce the intended first step while preserving model-driven follow-up behavior?
Your answer is incorrect
Strengthen the system prompt to say metadata extraction must happen first before any dependency or migration planning tools.
Explanation
Prompt instructions can improve behavior but do not deterministically enforce tool order. The observed failures already show that probabilistic compliance is not sufficient for a required first step.
Correct answer
Force the metadata extraction tool with tool_choice for the first request, then continue subsequent analysis in follow-up turns.
Explanation
Forced tool selection is the most reliable way to ensure a specific tool is called first when the workflow requires an initial structured step. After the metadata result is returned, later turns can use normal model-driven tool selection for dependency analysis and planning.
Inspect the assistant's natural language for phrases indicating metadata completion, then retry when the expected phrase is absent.
Explanation
Parsing natural language as a workflow control signal is brittle and can fail when wording changes. Tool orchestration should rely on structured API controls and tool results rather than assistant text phrasing.
Set tool_choice to any for the first request, relying on tool descriptions to make metadata extraction the likely selection.
Explanation
The any setting guarantees that some tool is called, but it does not guarantee which tool is selected. If multiple tools are available, the model could still choose dependency analysis or plan generation first.
Overall explanation
Forced tool selection is appropriate when a workflow requires a specific tool to run before other model-selected actions. Using tool_choice: {"type": "tool", "name": "extract_metadata"} or the equivalent named tool form ensures the first request produces the required structured tool call, and the application can then return the tool result before allowing follow-up analysis.

The underlying tradeoff is between deterministic sequencing for a required prerequisite and model-driven flexibility for later steps. Once the canonical metadata is in the conversation, subsequent turns can use tool_choice: "auto" or another appropriate setting so Claude can decide whether to analyze dependencies, inspect files, or generate the migration plan.

tool_choice: "any" is insufficient because it requires a tool call but does not require the specific metadata tool. Prompt-only instructions remain probabilistic, and natural-language parsing for completion is an anti-pattern because it couples control flow to wording rather than structured tool use.

Question 33
Correct
Scenario: Multi-Agent Research System You are building a multi-agent research system using the Claude Agent SDK. A coordinator agent delegates to specialized subagents: one searches the web, one analyzes documents, one synthesizes findings, and one generates reports. The system researches topics and produces comprehensive, cited reports. During a run, the document-analysis subagent asks a source retrieval MCP tool for the full text of a licensed market report. The backend rejects the request because the license permits summaries and short excerpts only. Today the tool returns “access denied,” causing the coordinator to retry with paraphrased requests and then mark the source as unavailable. What change would best let the agents handle this case correctly?
Report a permission error and instruct the coordinator to escalate to infrastructure owners for immediate credential repair.
Explanation
A permission error implies that credentials, entitlements, or access configuration might be fixed to allow the operation. Here the stated constraint is a licensing business rule that still allows summaries and excerpts, so credential repair is not the right recovery path.
Your answer is correct
Return isError true with errorCategory business, isRetryable false, and guidance to request summaries or short excerpts instead.
Explanation
This treats the rejection as a business rule violation rather than an outage or credential problem. The non-retryable flag prevents wasted retries, while the explanation gives the coordinator and subagent a viable recovery path within the licensing constraint.
Return a successful empty result set so the synthesis agent can continue without exposing licensing details.
Explanation
A successful empty result misrepresents a blocked request as a valid query with no matches. This suppresses important context, causing the final report to omit a source without explaining the coverage gap or trying allowed alternatives.
Classify the rejection as transient and retry with backoff using progressively narrower full-text retrieval queries.
Explanation
The backend rejection is caused by a stable licensing rule, not a temporary timeout or service outage. Retrying full-text retrieval only wastes latency and may repeatedly violate the same business constraint.
Overall explanation
Structured MCP errors should give agents enough information to decide whether to retry, revise the request, explain a limitation, or escalate. In this case, the backend is enforcing a licensing constraint: full-text retrieval is not allowed, but summaries and short excerpts are allowed. Returning isError: true with errorCategory: "business", isRetryable: false, and a human-readable explanation lets the coordinator avoid useless retries and choose an allowed retrieval strategy.

The key principle is distinguishing business rule violations from transient failures and permission problems. Transient retry logic is appropriate for timeouts or temporary service unavailability, but it cannot overcome a stable contractual limitation. Returning an empty successful result is an anti-pattern because it hides the difference between “no relevant source exists” and “a relevant source exists but cannot be accessed in that form.” Treating the case as credential repair also misroutes recovery, since the issue is not missing authorization to perform an otherwise permitted action.

Question 34
Correct
Scenario: Structured Data Extraction You are building a structured data extraction system using Claude. The system extracts information from unstructured documents, validates output using JSON schemas, and maintains high accuracy. It must handle edge cases gracefully and integrate with downstream systems. Your invoice extraction pipeline already returns syntactically valid structured objects, but semantic validators reject about 7% of documents because line-item totals do not sum to the stated total or normalized dates fail business rules. Most rejected documents contain the needed values, but the model placed or formatted them incorrectly. What should you change to recover these cases while preserving validation rigor?
Ask Claude to explain likely extraction mistakes in natural language, then parse that explanation to update records.
Explanation
Natural language explanations are not a reliable interface for updating structured records. Parsing free-form text introduces avoidable brittleness when the system already has structured extraction output and deterministic validator feedback available.
Loosen the JSON schema by making rejected fields nullable, then route missing values to downstream reconciliation jobs.
Explanation
Making fields nullable is useful when the source may genuinely omit information, but it is not appropriate for bypassing recoverable extraction errors. This would hide validation failures and push avoidable cleanup into downstream systems instead of correcting the extraction.
Retry the original extraction prompt up to three times, accepting the first response that passes schema validation.
Explanation
Repeating the same prompt without feedback is a weak recovery strategy because the model receives no signal about what was wrong. An arbitrary retry cap also risks accepting outputs that are syntactically valid while still failing the semantic requirements that caused the rejection.
Your answer is correct
Send a follow-up request containing the source document, failed extraction, and precise validator messages for targeted correction.
Explanation
This approach gives Claude the information needed to correct recoverable extraction mistakes without weakening validation rules. Including the original document, the failed output, and the exact validator feedback focuses the retry on the specific defect rather than asking for another blind attempt.
Overall explanation
Retry with targeted feedback is the right pattern when validation failures are caused by format, placement, or semantic consistency errors and the required information is present in the source. The retry should include the original document, the failed extraction, and the exact validation messages so Claude can focus on correcting the specific issue rather than redoing the task blindly.

The key tradeoff is preserving strict validation while enabling recoverable self-correction. JSON schema or tool-based structured output can reduce syntax problems, but it does not eliminate semantic errors such as totals that do not reconcile or values placed in the wrong field. Learn more about structured output patterns in Tool Use and prompt iteration in Prompt Engineering.

Blind retries with arbitrary caps are an anti-pattern because they consume additional calls without giving the model actionable information. Loosening schemas to bypass failed validation weakens data quality guarantees, and parsing natural language explanations creates a brittle downstream integration. A validation-feedback loop keeps the schema strict while giving the model a precise opportunity to repair recoverable extraction errors.

Question 35
Correct
Scenario: Structured Data Extraction You are building a structured data extraction system using Claude. The system extracts information from unstructured documents, validates output using JSON schemas, and maintains high accuracy. It must handle edge cases gracefully and integrate with downstream systems. Your extraction pipeline includes a QA pass that flags possible mistakes in supplier contract records before they enter the downstream procurement system. Over the last month, procurement analysts accepted many findings about missing renewal clauses but overturned most findings involving informal pricing language. Current logs store only document ID, field name, confidence, and finding text, making it difficult to prioritize prompt and validator improvements. What change should you make first?
Store only analyst accept or reject decisions per document, then randomly sample overturned findings for manual discussion.
Explanation
Accept or reject labels are useful, but document-level labels alone do not explain what triggered each finding. Random manual discussion can reveal examples, but it does not create systematic segmentation for prompt and validator improvement.
Add a system prompt instruction telling Claude to report only findings that procurement analysts would likely accept.
Explanation
This is too vague to create a reliable feedback loop and provides no structured data for diagnosing failure modes. It relies on Claude predicting reviewer preferences rather than measuring which patterns actually lead to accepted or overturned findings.
Your answer is correct
Add a structured detected_pattern field to each QA finding, then analyze acceptance rates by pattern and document type.
Explanation
This captures the recurring source pattern or code construct that triggered each finding, making the feedback loop analyzable rather than anecdotal. Segmenting outcomes by pattern and document type shows which prompts or validators need refinement without suppressing useful categories wholesale.
Increase the QA confidence threshold globally, suppressing all lower-confidence findings before analysts review extracted contract records.
Explanation
A global threshold may reduce volume, but it hides which specific patterns are producing low-value findings. It can also suppress useful findings in categories that are performing well, reducing recall without addressing the root cause.
Overall explanation
Feedback loop design requires recording why a finding was produced, not just whether it was accepted or overturned. Adding a structured detected_pattern field lets the team group findings by the source pattern that triggered them, such as informal pricing language, missing renewal clauses, conflicting dates, or nonstandard tables.

This approach works because extraction quality problems are often unevenly distributed across document types and source patterns. By analyzing acceptance rates by detected_pattern and document type, teams can refine prompts, validation rules, or few-shot examples for the categories causing the most false positives while preserving high-value checks.

Global threshold changes and vague instructions like “only report likely accepted findings” are anti-patterns because they reduce signal without explaining failure modes. Storing only accept or reject decisions is also incomplete, since it lacks the structured metadata needed to identify recurring causes.

Scenario: Developer Productivity with Claude You are building developer productivity tools using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent helps engineers explore unfamiliar codebases, understand legacy systems, generate boilerplate code, and automate repetitive tasks. It uses built-in tools (Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob) and integrates with MCP servers. In a developer productivity workflow, Claude has generated a helper that scaffolds new internal SDK integrations. Review shows three failures: retry handling conflicts with your error-normalization helper, generated config duplicates an existing block, and the naming fix proposed for one path breaks another path using the same template. Each attempted single-issue fix has reintroduced one of the other failures. What is the best next refinement step?
Ask Claude to fix the failures sequentially in separate turns, starting with the easiest failing assertion.
Explanation
Sequential fixes work best when issues are independent and do not affect the same code paths. Here, prior single-issue fixes have already reintroduced other failures, so continuing sequentially is likely to cause churn.
Your answer is correct
Send one detailed refinement request describing all observed failures, shared constraints, and expected behavior across the affected call paths.
Explanation
When issues interact, fixing them together helps Claude reason about the shared constraints and avoid reintroducing one problem while solving another. A single detailed refinement request gives Claude the full dependency surface needed to produce a coherent patch.
Open separate Claude sessions for each failure and merge whichever patch passes its local test first.
Explanation
Separate sessions isolate context, which can be useful for independent exploration, but it is risky when fixes interact. Each session would lack awareness of the other constraints, increasing the chance of incompatible patches.
Tell Claude the output is wrong and ask it to be more careful before trying again.
Explanation
Vague corrective feedback does not provide the concrete failure patterns or constraints Claude needs to improve. Asking Claude to be more careful is an anti-pattern because it relies on general caution rather than actionable evidence.
Overall explanation
Interacting failures should be refined together. When several problems affect the same helper, template, or call path, Claude needs the complete set of constraints in one request so it can reason about tradeoffs and produce a coherent change. This is different from independent issues, where sequential iteration can keep each turn focused.

Why the other approaches fail: fixing one failure at a time is appropriate only when changes do not interact, but the observed regressions show the fixes share implementation surface. Parallel isolated sessions can produce incompatible patches because each session sees only part of the problem. Vague feedback such as be more careful does not communicate test evidence, expected behavior, or constraints, so it rarely improves reliability.

The underlying principle is to match the refinement style to the coupling between problems: use focused sequential turns for independent fixes, and use a single comprehensive refinement when solutions constrain each other.

Question 37

Scenario: Developer Productivity with Claude You are building developer productivity tools using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent helps engineers explore unfamiliar codebases, understand legacy systems, generate boilerplate code, and automate repetitive tasks. It uses built-in tools (Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob) and integrates with MCP servers. A team asks the productivity agent to add a "cancel renewal" workflow to a legacy subscription service. The initial implementation point is unclear because cancellation behavior appears split across command-line scripts, web handlers, and scheduled jobs. In earlier similar tasks, immediate edits repeatedly targeted the wrong abstraction and had to be rolled back after tests exposed broken shared behavior. Which workflow should the tool recommend first?
Proceed with direct execution, relying on test failures to reveal hidden dependencies and guide successive corrective edits.
Explanation
This treats failed implementation attempts as the primary discovery mechanism, which is a costly anti-pattern for unfamiliar legacy code. Tests are valuable for validation, but they should not replace upfront exploration when the correct design location is unclear.
Instruct Claude to read every repository file first, then implement changes in the same extended session.
Explanation
Reading the entire repository upfront wastes context on irrelevant information and can degrade attention on the files that matter. A targeted exploration and design phase is more reliable than filling one long session with exhaustive discovery output.
Start separate direct-execution sessions for each suspected module, then manually combine the resulting edits later.
Explanation
Separate direct-execution sessions can produce conflicting changes because each session lacks a shared design baseline. Session isolation can help compare divergent strategies, but starting edits independently before understanding the flow increases merge and consistency risks.
Your answer is correct
Use plan mode to map relevant flows and compare implementation points before allowing file modifications.
Explanation
This is the best fit because the task has uncertainty about where the change belongs, and previous immediate edits caused avoidable rollback work. Plan mode lets Claude explore the codebase and design an approach before committing changes, reducing the chance of modifying the wrong abstraction.
Overall explanation
Plan mode is appropriate when the main risk is choosing the wrong implementation approach before enough of the codebase is understood. In this situation, the feature request may sound straightforward, but the cancellation behavior is distributed across several possible entry points and prior direct edits caused rollback work.

The underlying tradeoff is between speed of starting edits and confidence in the design direction. Plan mode adds a small upfront exploration cost, but it enables safer codebase investigation and design before file modifications, which is exactly what prevents expensive rework in unfamiliar legacy systems.

Using test failures as the discovery strategy is an anti-pattern because tests should validate a proposed solution, not serve as the primary way to find the right abstraction. Exhaustively reading every file can overload context, while independent direct-execution sessions risk inconsistent edits without a shared plan.

A single happy-path run is an anti-pattern when failures involve null handling, retry behavior, and large input performance. It validates only the easiest case and is likely to miss exactly the defects already observed in pilot usage.
Your answer is correct
Create tests for expected behavior, edge cases, and performance constraints first, then iterate by sending Claude failing results.
Explanation
This turns ambiguous implementation quality into objective acceptance criteria before code generation begins. Sharing specific failing test output gives Claude precise feedback for incremental correction, which is more reliable than asking for broad improvements.
Let Claude implement the adapter, then rely on manual code review to catch missed cases after generation.
Explanation
Manual review can find issues, but it is reactive, inconsistent, and does not provide a repeatable improvement loop. It also pushes quality detection onto humans instead of using concrete failures to guide Claude toward the expected behavior.
Give Claude a longer prose specification and ask it to reason carefully before producing the complete implementation.
Explanation
Longer prose may clarify some intent, but it still leaves correctness dependent on interpretation and does not create executable acceptance criteria. The observed uneven results show that prose-only instructions are not providing enough feedback for reliable refinement.
Overall explanation
Test-driven iteration is the best fit when engineers can define expected behavior, edge cases, and performance constraints before implementation. Creating tests first gives Claude concrete targets, and feeding back failing test output creates a focused refinement loop rather than relying on subjective review comments.

The underlying principle is to convert requirements into observable acceptance criteria. Claude can then iterate against specific failures, such as a null field assertion, a retry count mismatch, or a performance threshold violation, instead of guessing what “make it robust” means.

Longer prose specifications can help, but they do not replace executable feedback. Manual review is useful as a safeguard, but it is slower and less systematic than tests for repeated generation workflows. A single happy-path run is especially weak because it ignores the very categories where the pilot is failing.

Question 39
Correct
Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. During rollout, the agent frequently spends its first several turns probing the support knowledge server with broad queries such as “what policies exist for billing disputes?” and “which return exceptions are available?” These exploratory calls consume context, sometimes miss relevant policy documents, and delay straightforward resolutions before any customer-specific action occurs. What design change would best improve the agent’s visibility into available support information while preserving tools for customer-specific actions?
Build keyword rules that map phrases like refund, late, or angry to predefined policy documents before tool use.
Explanation
Keyword routing is brittle for high-ambiguity support requests because customers describe the same issue in many different ways. It can also overfit to surface terms such as “angry” rather than identifying the actual policy area or customer need.
Your answer is correct
Expose the support policy index and knowledge-base catalog as MCP resources, while keeping tools for selected record actions.
Explanation
MCP resources are appropriate for exposing read-oriented catalogs and reference data that the application or agent can inspect without exploratory action calls. This gives the agent visibility into available policy content while preserving MCP tools for operations such as customer lookup, order lookup, refunds, and escalation.
Copy the full return, billing, and escalation knowledge base into the system prompt for every agent session.
Explanation
Putting the full knowledge base into every prompt bloats context and increases the chance that important details are lost among irrelevant material. It also makes updates harder to manage and does not provide a structured catalog of available content.
Add a mandatory startup tool call that lists every policy document before the agent handles each customer request.
Explanation
A mandatory startup tool call still consumes a tool turn for every request, including simple cases that may not need policy discovery. It treats read-oriented catalog visibility as an action, which increases latency and context usage instead of reducing exploratory tool calls.
Overall explanation
MCP resources are designed for exposing read-oriented information such as content catalogs, documentation hierarchies, policy indexes, or database schemas. In this scenario, a policy catalog resource lets the agent see what support information exists without spending several tool calls discovering it, while MCP tools remain reserved for actions such as get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, and escalate_to_human.

The underlying architectural principle is to separate visibility into available content from model-initiated actions. Resources help reduce unnecessary exploratory tool calls, preserve context budget, and improve the agent’s ability to choose relevant information for the customer’s issue.

A mandatory startup listing tool still forces an action on every request and adds latency. Copying the full knowledge base into the system prompt creates context bloat and makes policy updates less manageable. Keyword routing is an anti-pattern for ambiguous support language because it relies on brittle surface matches rather than structured visibility into the support content available.

Question 40
Correct
Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. A customer writes: "I was charged twice, my return label never arrived, and I cannot sign in to check the order." The coordinator currently launches billing, returns, and account subagents with the same prompt: "Investigate this customer issue and recommend a resolution." Logs show each subagent calls overlapping tools for the same order, repeats the same facts, and sometimes recommends conflicting next steps. What orchestration change would most effectively improve reliability and efficiency?
Route every request through returns, billing, and account subagents sequentially, regardless of the customer's stated concerns.
Explanation
A fixed full pipeline wastes work when some specialists are not needed and increases latency. It also does not solve the overlap problem because each subagent can still investigate the same issue unless the coordinator scopes their assignments.
Your answer is correct
Assign each subagent a distinct issue boundary and shared case facts, then synthesize their non-overlapping findings centrally.
Explanation
This approach gives each subagent a clear area of responsibility while preserving the coordinator as the central router and synthesizer. It reduces duplicate tool calls, prevents conflicting investigations, and lets the final response combine the results into one coherent customer resolution.
Send the full customer transcript to every subagent, then use majority agreement to choose the resolution.
Explanation
This repeats the current failure mode by asking every subagent to investigate the whole case. Majority agreement is an anti-pattern because overlapping agents can reinforce the same incomplete or incorrect interpretation instead of producing complementary findings.
Allow subagents to message each other directly so they can divide remaining work without coordinator involvement.
Explanation
Direct subagent communication reduces observability and weakens centralized error handling and state management. In coordinator-subagent patterns, the coordinator should control delegation, information routing, and final aggregation.
Overall explanation
Correct orchestration in a coordinator-subagent pattern depends on giving subagents complementary assignments rather than duplicative prompts. For a multi-concern support case, the coordinator should pass shared case facts, assign distinct scopes such as billing dispute, return label status, and account access, then aggregate findings into a unified resolution.

The underlying tradeoff is between parallel specialization and uncontrolled redundancy. Parallel subagents are valuable when their work is partitioned by issue, subtopic, or source type; they become unreliable when every subagent receives the same broad prompt and independently reaches overlapping conclusions.

Using majority agreement over duplicate investigations is an anti-pattern because duplicated context does not create independent coverage. Routing every case through all specialists is also inefficient and fails to scope work. Letting subagents coordinate directly bypasses the coordinator's role in observability, error handling, and controlled information flow.

Question 41
Correct
Scenario: Developer Productivity with Claude You are building developer productivity tools using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent helps engineers explore unfamiliar codebases, understand legacy systems, generate boilerplate code, and automate repetitive tasks. It uses built-in tools (Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob) and integrates with MCP servers. A coordinator agent delegates codebase exploration to subagents before asking an implementation subagent to generate migration scaffolding. In reviews, engineers find the final proposal often mixes findings from different packages, cites helper functions without file locations, and cannot explain which search result or source file supports a recommended change. The individual subagents found useful facts, but their handoffs were free-form summaries. What change would best improve downstream reliability while preserving attribution?
Ask the implementation subagent to reread the repository broadly and infer supporting locations from each summarized recommendation before editing.
Explanation
Rereading the repository shifts recovery work to a downstream agent and can still produce incorrect inferred provenance. It also wastes context and tool calls because the original exploration agents already had the relevant source locations when they made their findings.
Your answer is correct
Require subagents to return structured handoff records with findings separated from file paths, symbols, line ranges, commands, and source excerpts.
Explanation
Structured handoff records preserve both the discovered content and the metadata needed to verify it later. Separating facts from attribution metadata helps the implementation subagent use findings accurately without losing file locations, source excerpts, or command provenance.
Strip source details from subagent outputs to reduce context size, then use Grep later when reviewers request justification.
Explanation
Removing attribution is an anti-pattern because it creates exactly the traceability gap reviewers are reporting. Later searches may not recover the same context, especially when symbols are duplicated across packages or code has changed.
Have each exploration subagent write longer narrative summaries that include reasoning traces and repeated reminders to cite sources.
Explanation
Longer prose summaries increase context consumption without reliably preserving machine-usable provenance. Reasoning traces are not a substitute for explicit fields such as file path, line range, symbol name, and source excerpt.
Overall explanation
Structured subagent handoffs are the best fit when one agent's findings must be used by another agent for implementation or synthesis. The coordinator should require each exploration subagent to return records that distinguish the discovered fact from metadata such as file_path, symbol, line_range, source_excerpt, and the command or tool result that produced the observation.

The underlying principle is that subagents operate with isolated context, so any downstream agent only receives what the coordinator explicitly passes along. Free-form summaries often compress away provenance, which makes later recommendations harder to verify and easier to misattribute across similar packages or duplicated helper functions.

Asking a downstream implementation agent to infer locations, adding longer narrative reasoning, or stripping metadata to save space all fail because they treat provenance as optional. In production developer tools, attribution is part of the work product, not decoration, because engineers need to validate recommendations against concrete files and source evidence.

Question 42
Correct
Scenario: Structured Data Extraction You are building a structured data extraction system using Claude. The system extracts information from unstructured documents, validates output using JSON schemas, and maintains high accuracy. It must handle edge cases gracefully and integrate with downstream systems. Your extraction QA pass produces JSON records that validate successfully, but reviewers report the findings are hard to act on. Some records describe vague problems like "date issue," others omit where the problem appears, and suggested fixes vary between full sentences, fragments, and empty strings. The downstream ticketing system accepts the records, but reviewers spend significant time interpreting them. What change would most effectively improve consistency?
Post-process each finding with regular expressions to infer missing locations, severities, and suggested fixes from the text.
Explanation
This is an anti-pattern because it attempts to recover structured meaning from inconsistent natural language after the fact. Regex post-processing is brittle for varied document language and can introduce incorrect locations or severities.
Your answer is correct
Add targeted examples showing complete actionable findings with document location, affected field, issue description, severity, and suggested correction.
Explanation
Few-shot examples are especially effective when the model understands the task but produces inconsistent formatting or incomplete actionable details. Showing complete examples teaches the expected structure and level of specificity more reliably than prose instructions alone.
Make every finding field non-null in the schema so validation fails whenever Claude leaves any reviewer detail empty.
Explanation
A stricter schema can force syntactic completeness, but it does not teach the model what good content should look like. If some details are genuinely unavailable, forcing non-null fields can also encourage fabricated values rather than useful uncertainty.
Add a general instruction requiring concise, high-confidence findings and asking Claude to avoid vague or incomplete reviewer notes.
Explanation
General instructions such as being concise or high-confidence are too vague to define the desired output shape. They do not demonstrate what a complete actionable finding looks like, so formatting and specificity are likely to remain inconsistent.
Overall explanation
Few-shot prompting is the best fit when outputs are valid but inconsistent in presentation, specificity, or actionability. Targeted examples demonstrate the exact shape of a strong finding, including location, affected field, issue description, severity, and suggested correction, so Claude can generalize that pattern to new documents.

The underlying tradeoff is that schemas enforce structural validity, while examples communicate judgment and formatting expectations. A JSON schema can ensure fields exist, but it cannot by itself show what counts as a useful issue description or a reviewer-ready suggested fix.

Vague instructions such as "be concise" or "avoid incomplete notes" often fail because they do not define the desired behavior concretely. Regex-based post-processing is brittle because it tries to reconstruct meaning from inconsistent free text, and making every field non-null can increase hallucination when source evidence is missing.

Question 43
Correct
Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. During development, you resume yesterday's named investigation session about refund errors. In that session, Claude had read <code>refund_policy.md</code>, the <code>process_refund</code> tool schema, and <code>escalation_rules.md</code>, and most of its analysis is still relevant. Since then, a teammate changed the refund threshold rules and updated <code>process_refund</code> parameter names. You need Claude to continue designing the fix without repeating the whole investigation or relying on stale assumptions. What is the best next step?
Start a fresh session and require complete codebase re-exploration whenever any previously analyzed file has changed.
Explanation
Starting fresh can be appropriate when prior context is broadly stale, but the situation states that most analysis remains relevant. A full re-exploration wastes time and context when only specific files need refreshed analysis.
Fork the old session into competing branches and let each branch decide whether prior tool results remain trustworthy.
Explanation
Forking is useful for exploring divergent approaches from a shared baseline, not for refreshing stale facts after file changes. The branches would still inherit the same outdated assumptions unless the changed files are explicitly reintroduced or re-read.
Your answer is correct
Resume the session, identify the changed policy and tool files, and request targeted re-analysis before continuing implementation decisions.
Explanation
This preserves the useful context from the previous investigation while explicitly invalidating the parts most likely to be stale. Targeted re-analysis lets Claude refresh its understanding of the changed files before using prior conclusions for implementation decisions.
Resume the session normally and rely on Claude to infer changed assumptions from the prior conversation history during implementation.
Explanation
This is an anti-pattern because the prior conversation history contains stale tool results and outdated analysis. Claude cannot reliably infer external file changes unless they are provided in the resumed context or rediscovered through tool use.
Overall explanation
Session resumption is most effective when the prior context is still mostly valid, but the agent is told what changed before it continues making decisions. In this case, resuming the named session preserves the useful investigation history while identifying the changed policy and tool files prompts Claude to perform targeted re-analysis before relying on previous conclusions.

The underlying tradeoff is between context continuity and staleness control. Resuming without mentioning changed files risks decisions based on obsolete tool outputs or policy analysis, while always starting from scratch wastes useful context and increases exploration overhead.

fork_session is valuable for comparing divergent strategies from a shared baseline, but it does not automatically refresh stale information. Likewise, summarization or continuation alone cannot guarantee that outdated file contents are replaced with current facts.

Question 44
Correct
Scenario: Structured Data Extraction You are building a structured data extraction system using Claude. The system extracts information from unstructured documents, validates output using JSON schemas, and maintains high accuracy. It must handle edge cases gracefully and integrate with downstream systems. A coordinator splits each document into sections and sends them to extraction subagents for fields such as parties, dates, totals, and obligations. During testing, one subagent sometimes loses access to a section-level source system for a few minutes. The current implementation either returns an empty section extraction marked as successful or aborts the entire document extraction, causing downstream systems to misinterpret the document state. What should you change?
Your answer is correct
Have subagents report unresolved failures with attempted section, failure type, partial fields, and recovery suggestions for coordinator handling.
Explanation
This preserves valid work while making unresolved failures visible to the coordinator and downstream review logic. It enables targeted retry, alternate processing, or human review without falsely claiming completeness or discarding successful extractions.
Terminate the entire document workflow whenever any subagent cannot access its assigned source section.
Explanation
This throws away successfully extracted fields from other sections even when the failure is localized and potentially recoverable. It also prevents the coordinator from making informed decisions using partial results and targeted recovery paths.
Return an empty extraction object for the failed section so downstream validators can treat missing fields consistently.
Explanation
This silently suppresses the access failure by making it look like the section was processed successfully and contained no data. Downstream validators cannot distinguish a valid empty result from an unavailable source, which can create false confidence.
Retry the failed section until it succeeds, withholding all partial extractions from downstream systems until completion.
Explanation
Retries can be useful for transient failures, but unbounded retry behavior can block processing indefinitely and hide partial progress. The coordinator still needs structured context about what failed, what was attempted, and what valid data is available.
Overall explanation
Reliable multi-agent extraction requires preserving both successful work and unresolved failure context. When a subagent cannot process one section, it should return enough structured information for the coordinator to decide whether to retry, use an alternate path, proceed with coverage gaps, or route only the affected portion to human review.

The key principle is to distinguish valid empty results from access or processing failures. An empty extraction can mean the source contained no matching data, while an access failure means the system does not know whether data was present. Treating both as success creates false completeness for downstream systems.

Aborting the entire document on a single localized failure is also an anti-pattern because it discards useful partial results and prevents more granular recovery. Blindly retrying until success is similarly risky because it can stall workflows and obscure the current state of the extraction.

Context Management & Reliability
Question 45
Correct
Scenario: Multi-Agent Research System You are building a multi-agent research system using the Claude Agent SDK. A coordinator agent delegates to specialized subagents: one searches the web, one analyzes documents, one synthesizes findings, and one generates reports. The system researches topics and produces comprehensive, cited reports. During testing, a report on remote work productivity cites two recent, credible studies with different productivity statistics. The synthesis agent currently chooses the higher number because it appears in a larger sample study, and the report presents it as the single definitive result. Reviewers note that both studies are methodologically credible but measure productivity differently. What change would most improve the reliability of the final report?
Ask the web search subagent to keep searching until it finds a third source matching one of the reported statistics.
Explanation
Searching for a tie-breaker can bias the system toward confirmation rather than faithful synthesis. Additional sources may be useful, but they should not replace explicit handling of an already identified credible conflict.
Select the statistic from the study with the largest sample size and suppress the smaller study to avoid confusing readers.
Explanation
Choosing one value solely by sample size is an anti-pattern when the sources measure different things or use different methods. It hides credible disagreement and can make the report appear more certain than the evidence supports.
Your answer is correct
Preserve both statistics with source attribution, methodology notes, and a conflict annotation for the report generator to present transparently.
Explanation
This approach preserves uncertainty instead of forcing a false single answer when credible sources disagree. Including source attribution and methodology context lets downstream readers understand why the numbers differ and evaluate the evidence appropriately.
Average the conflicting statistics into one blended estimate and cite both sources as supporting the combined value.
Explanation
Averaging can create a number that no source actually reported, especially when methodologies or definitions differ. Citing both sources as support for the averaged value misrepresents the provenance of the claim.
Overall explanation
Conflicting credible sources require transparent uncertainty handling. When two reliable sources report different statistics, the synthesis pipeline should preserve both values, attach source attribution, and explain relevant methodological differences instead of collapsing the disagreement into a single unsupported claim.

The underlying principle is provenance preservation: downstream report generation should maintain claim-source mappings, methodology context, and conflict annotations so readers can verify and interpret the evidence. This is especially important in multi-agent systems, where summarization can otherwise strip away the reasons that findings disagree.

Selecting the larger-sample statistic, averaging incompatible values, or searching for a convenient tie-breaker all create misleading certainty. These approaches obscure uncertainty, weaken source traceability, and can cause the final report to misrepresent what the evidence actually says.

Question 46
Correct
Scenario: Developer Productivity with Claude You are building developer productivity tools using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent helps engineers explore unfamiliar codebases, understand legacy systems, generate boilerplate code, and automate repetitive tasks. It uses built-in tools (Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob) and integrates with MCP servers. The same agent now handles two request types. Dependency license reviews follow a stable rubric with known checks, while production bug investigations in unfamiliar services vary based on discovered call paths, logs, and failing tests. The current single-pass prompt misses checklist items during reviews and wastes effort during investigations. Which decomposition strategy is most appropriate?
Use dynamic task planning for every workflow, allowing the agent to redefine review criteria as it discovers code patterns.
Explanation
Dynamic planning is useful when the path is unknown, but it is unnecessary and risky for stable checklist-driven reviews. Allowing the agent to redefine review criteria can reduce consistency and undermine the purpose of a known rubric.
Use the same fixed sequential checklist for both workflows, requiring every investigation to complete every predefined step.
Explanation
A fixed sequence can work for stable review rubrics, but it is poorly suited to open-ended investigations where discoveries should change the next action. Forcing every investigation through every step wastes tool calls and can distract from the most relevant evidence.
Your answer is correct
Use a fixed prompt chain for stable review rubrics, and let the agent adapt subtasks during open-ended investigations.
Explanation
Predictable workflows with known steps benefit from prompt chaining because each pass can focus on a specific aspect of the rubric. Open-ended investigations benefit from adaptive decomposition because later subtasks should depend on what the agent discovers in code, logs, and tests.
Use one large prompt for both request types, asking the agent to reason carefully before using any tools.
Explanation
A single large prompt increases attention dilution and makes it easier for the agent to miss checklist items or over-generalize during investigations. Asking the agent to reason carefully does not create the focused passes or adaptive branching needed for these distinct workflow shapes.
Overall explanation
Correct approach: Match the decomposition pattern to the workflow shape. A stable dependency license review has known review dimensions, so a fixed prompt chain gives each pass a focused objective and reduces missed checklist items. A production bug investigation in an unfamiliar service is open-ended, so the agent should use adaptive decomposition, creating new subtasks based on discovered call paths, logs, and failing tests.

Architectural principle: Reliable agent design is not about always using the most flexible pattern. It is about choosing the least complex structure that preserves quality: deterministic chains for predictable multi-step work, adaptive plans for exploratory work where intermediate findings change the next best step.

Why the other approaches fail: A single large prompt is an attention dilution anti-pattern because it asks the model to juggle all constraints at once. Applying the same fixed checklist to every investigation wastes effort and can miss emergent leads. Making every workflow dynamically planned adds unnecessary variability to stable reviews and may weaken consistency when the criteria should remain fixed.

Question 47
Correct
Scenario: Structured Data Extraction You are building a structured data extraction system using Claude. The system extracts information from unstructured documents, validates output using JSON schemas, and maintains high accuracy. It must handle edge cases gracefully and integrate with downstream systems. Your extraction QA pass reviews Claude's JSON outputs before downstream ingestion. Reviewers dismiss many findings because the QA prompt flags harmless differences: inferred date formats, optional fields absent from the source, and wording variations that do not change extracted values. The current prompt says, "Check the extraction for accuracy and report any problems." What change would most effectively improve precision?
Require the QA pass to flag every schema field that is null, even when the source document omits it.
Explanation
This would increase false positives by treating valid absence as an extraction error. If a document does not contain optional information, null can be the correct output rather than a problem to report.
Increase the validation sample size and ask reviewers to manually ignore findings that are not actionable.
Explanation
More review volume may measure the problem better, but it does not improve the prompt's precision. Relying on reviewers to ignore low-value findings preserves the same false-positive burden and undermines trust.
Your answer is correct
Rewrite the QA prompt to define reportable errors, acceptable variations, and skip conditions with concrete examples for each category.
Explanation
Specific criteria give Claude clear boundaries for what counts as a finding versus an acceptable variation. This directly addresses the false positives caused by vague instructions like checking for accuracy without defining reportable conditions.
Add instructions that Claude should be conservative and report only findings where it feels highly confident.
Explanation
General confidence language is an anti-pattern because it does not define which cases should be reported or skipped. Claude's self-assessed confidence is not a reliable substitute for concrete categorical criteria.
Overall explanation
Explicit criteria are the most effective way to improve precision when a prompt produces false positives. A prompt like "check for accuracy" leaves Claude to infer what counts as an issue, so it may flag harmless formatting differences, valid nulls, or stylistic variations as problems.

The stronger approach is to define reportable categories, acceptable variations, and skip conditions. For example, report a value that contradicts the source or a source-present required field that was omitted, but skip optional fields absent from the document and normalized formats that preserve meaning.

Instructions such as "be conservative" or "only report high-confidence findings" are weak substitutes because they do not create operational decision boundaries. Flagging all null fields is also counterproductive in extraction systems, since nullable fields are often necessary to avoid fabrication when source data is absent.

The underlying principle is that precision improves when the model receives concrete decision rules and examples rather than broad quality goals. Learn more about prompt specificity and examples in Prompt Engineering.

Question 48
Correct
Scenario: Multi-Agent Research System You are building a multi-agent research system using the Claude Agent SDK. A coordinator agent delegates to specialized subagents: one searches the web, one analyzes documents, one synthesizes findings, and one generates reports. The system researches topics and produces comprehensive, cited reports. During production evaluation, reviewers find that first drafts are coherent and cited but often incomplete. For example, a report on AI regulation includes strong EU coverage, weak Asia-Pacific coverage, and unresolved contradictions between two market statistics. The current workflow sends the first synthesis directly to the report generator whenever all subagents return successfully. What change would most effectively improve report completeness without abandoning the coordinator-subagent architecture?
Have all subagents repeat their original broad assignments twice, then merge duplicate findings before sending results to synthesis.
Explanation
Repeating the same broad work is an inefficient anti-pattern because it does not target the specific missing evidence or contradictions. It increases latency and duplication while still failing to guarantee coverage of the identified gaps.
Instruct the report generator to hide low-coverage sections unless the synthesis agent marks every subsection as fully supported.
Explanation
This suppresses visible gaps rather than improving the underlying research coverage. It can produce cleaner-looking reports, but reviewers still receive incomplete analysis and may lose important caveats.
Raise the coordinator's maximum iteration count to a fixed cap, stopping after five passes regardless of remaining coverage gaps.
Explanation
A fixed iteration cap is useful as a safety guard, but it should not be the primary completion condition. Stopping based on an arbitrary pass count can terminate too early or waste work after coverage is already sufficient.
Your answer is correct
Add a coordinator review loop that checks synthesis coverage, redelegates targeted follow-ups, and reruns synthesis until quality criteria are met.
Explanation
This uses the coordinator as the control point for assessing whether synthesized findings satisfy the research goal. Targeted redelegation lets the system fill specific gaps or resolve contradictions without repeating the entire pipeline unnecessarily.
Overall explanation
Coordinator-led iterative refinement is the right pattern when a multi-agent research system produces coherent but incomplete outputs. The coordinator should evaluate synthesis quality against explicit coverage criteria, identify gaps or contradictions, redelegate targeted work to search or analysis subagents, and rerun synthesis with the new findings.

The underlying architectural principle is that the coordinator owns task decomposition, result aggregation, and quality control. Successful subagent completion only means assigned work finished, not that the overall research question has been adequately covered.

Suppressing weak sections in the report generator hides the problem instead of improving evidence quality. Repeating broad assignments creates duplicate work and may still miss the same gaps, while using an arbitrary iteration count as the main stopping rule ignores whether coverage is actually sufficient.

Question 49

Scenario: Structured Data Extraction You are building a structured data extraction system using Claude. The system extracts information from unstructured documents, validates output using JSON schemas, and maintains high accuracy. It must handle edge cases gracefully and integrate with downstream systems. You are about to process 80,000 archived vendor contracts overnight. A new extraction prompt and schema passed a few hand-picked examples, but historical documents vary by template, scanned OCR quality, and contract addenda. Reprocessing failures delays a downstream migration. What should you do next?
Your answer is correct
Run a representative pilot batch, analyze validation failures and null patterns, refine the prompt, then submit the full workload.
Explanation
A representative pilot batch exposes real formatting variation and failure modes before they become expensive at full scale. Refining the prompt and schema based on pilot validation results improves first-pass success and reduces resubmission work.
Split documents randomly into equal daily batches and tune the prompt only after all batches finish processing.
Explanation
Random daily batches reduce operational volume per run but still defer learning until after substantial processing has already occurred. This delays prompt correction and can repeat the same avoidable failures across multiple submissions.
Submit the entire workload immediately, then resubmit every failed document after inspecting aggregate completion and error counts.
Explanation
Submitting the full workload before validating the prompt at representative scale risks multiplying the same extraction errors across thousands of documents. Aggregate counts also hide which templates, fields, or document conditions caused failures, making remediation slower.
Increase max_tokens for all batch requests so longer outputs can handle templates, addenda, and OCR noise more reliably.
Explanation
Increasing max_tokens can help only when outputs are being truncated, which is not the stated problem. Template variation and OCR noise usually require prompt, schema, and validation improvements rather than simply allowing longer responses.
Overall explanation
Representative pilot processing is the best next step before submitting a large extraction workload with a new prompt and schema. A small but representative sample should include known document variations, such as different templates, OCR quality levels, addenda, and edge cases, so validation failures reveal what will happen at production scale.

The key tradeoff is between fast full submission and maximizing first-pass success. The Message Batches API is useful for large, latency-tolerant workloads, but it does not remove the need to validate prompts and schemas before processing thousands of documents. Prompt refinement on a sample set reduces repeated failures, downstream delays, and resubmission overhead.

Submitting everything immediately is an anti-pattern because it turns prompt defects into large-scale operational cleanup. Increasing max_tokens addresses truncation, not semantic extraction quality or document variability. Splitting work into random daily batches controls throughput, but it still postpones learning and allows recurring failures to continue.

Scenario: Multi-Agent Research System You are building a multi-agent research system using the Claude Agent SDK. A coordinator agent delegates to specialized subagents: one searches the web, one analyzes documents, one synthesizes findings, and one generates reports. The system researches topics and produces comprehensive, cited reports. Your coordinator's document-analysis subagent depends on an internal library-catalog MCP server. It works in your local Claude Code session, but two teammates who cloned the repository cannot access the catalog tools, so their runs fall back to weaker web searches. Separately, one researcher is testing an experimental notes server that should not affect the team. What should you change?
Document per-user claude mcp add commands in README, and ask each researcher to recreate both servers locally.
Explanation
Manual per-user setup is an anti-pattern for tooling required by a shared workflow because it depends on every teammate configuring the same server correctly. It also mixes the personal experimental server into the team setup, which violates the stated need to keep it isolated.
Place both servers in each user's ~/.claude.json, and rely on onboarding scripts to synchronize changes across machines.
Explanation
User-scoped configuration is appropriate for personal tools, not shared project dependencies. Synchronizing user configuration through onboarding scripts is brittle and can still leave teammates with different tool availability across sessions or machines.
Your answer is correct
Move the required catalog server into project-scoped .mcp.json, and keep the experimental notes server in user-scoped ~/.claude.json.
Explanation
Shared MCP servers required for team workflows should live in project scope so they travel with the repository. Personal or experimental servers belong in user scope so they do not affect teammates or create inconsistent shared behavior.
Combine the catalog and notes integrations into one MCP server, and expose only role-specific tools to subagents.
Explanation
Tool scoping can reduce misuse by subagents, but it does not solve the configuration distribution problem. Combining a required team integration with a personal experiment also increases coupling and risks exposing experimental capabilities to the whole workflow.
Overall explanation
Shared MCP configuration should be placed at the project level when the tools are required for a team workflow. A project-scoped .mcp.json travels with the repository, which makes the coordinator and subagents see the same required MCP server after teammates clone or pull the project.

User-scoped configuration, such as ~/.claude.json, is the right place for personal or experimental MCP servers. This prevents one researcher's prototype integration from changing the tool environment for everyone else.

Asking every teammate to recreate shared servers manually is a reliability anti-pattern because configuration drift will produce inconsistent agent behavior. Combining unrelated required and experimental integrations does not address scope, and role-specific tool exposure is a separate design concern from how MCP servers are distributed across a team.

The underlying principle is to match configuration scope to the intended audience: project scope for shared team capabilities, user scope for individual tools. Learn more from the Claude Code Overview and the MCP Overview.

Question 51
Correct
Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. Production logs show get_customer returns ISO 8601 timestamps and numeric loyalty tiers, while lookup_order returns Unix timestamps and numeric status codes. The agent sometimes miscomputes return windows or mislabels order status after otherwise successful tool calls. You cannot change upstream MCP servers this quarter, but you need consistent reasoning across cases. What change best addresses the reliability issue?
Modify the final customer response parser to correct dates and statuses after Claude has already decided the resolution.
Explanation
Post-processing the final response is too late because the agent may already have made an incorrect decision using inconsistent intermediate data. This can cosmetically fix wording but cannot reliably repair faulty return-window calculations or order-status reasoning.
Add system instructions telling Claude to remember each tool's timestamp format and translate status codes during every reasoning step.
Explanation
System instructions can improve behavior but still rely on probabilistic compliance during every reasoning step. The problem is inconsistent input representation, so deterministic transformation before reasoning is more reliable than asking the model to repeatedly compensate.
Your answer is correct
Add a PostToolUse hook that converts each tool result into canonical dates, status labels, and tier fields before Claude sees it.
Explanation
A PostToolUse hook is appropriate because the issue occurs after successful tool execution but before the model reasons over the results. Normalizing the returned data into a consistent representation gives Claude stable inputs without requiring upstream MCP server changes.
Route all cases with mixed timestamp formats directly to escalate_to_human until the upstream MCP servers are standardized.
Explanation
Escalating these cases avoids some errors but unnecessarily reduces first-contact resolution for a problem that can be handled locally. Since the tool calls succeed and the formats are known, normalization is a better reliability mechanism than broad human handoff.
Overall explanation
Post-tool result normalization is the right architectural pattern when backend tools return successful results in inconsistent formats. A PostToolUse hook can transform raw MCP tool outputs into canonical fields, such as ISO dates, human-readable status labels, and consistent tier names, before Claude uses them for reasoning.

The underlying principle is to make critical input transformations deterministic and centralized rather than relying on the model to remember multiple backend conventions during every case. This improves reliability while preserving autonomy, since Claude still decides how to resolve the support issue after receiving clean, consistent facts.

Prompt instructions are less reliable because they depend on repeated model compliance. Final-response parsing is an anti-pattern here because it happens after the agent has already reasoned and possibly made the wrong decision. Broad escalation also solves the wrong problem, since known format differences can be normalized locally without sacrificing first-contact resolution.

Question 52
Correct
Scenario: Developer Productivity with Claude You are building developer productivity tools using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent helps engineers explore unfamiliar codebases, understand legacy systems, generate boilerplate code, and automate repetitive tasks. It uses built-in tools (Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob) and integrates with MCP servers. During a legacy payment module analysis, the coordinator first assigns one subagent to map database tables and another to trace API callers. Both return useful findings. The coordinator then invokes a planning subagent to propose a migration strategy, but the plan ignores the database constraints and caller list already discovered, recommending changes that would break known integrations. What should you change to make this orchestration more reliable?
Instruct the planning subagent to infer missing dependencies from file names when prior findings are unavailable.
Explanation
Inferring missing dependencies from file names is an anti-pattern because it encourages unsupported assumptions about code behavior. For migration planning, the subagent needs actual findings from prior analysis, including callers and database constraints, not guesses.
Allow subagents to message each other directly so the planning subagent can request missing analysis details.
Explanation
Direct subagent-to-subagent communication reduces coordinator observability and makes error handling and information routing harder to control. The coordinator should remain the hub for routing findings, managing dependencies, and deciding what context each subagent receives.
Replace the specialized subagents with one long-running generalist subagent that performs discovery and planning together.
Explanation
A single generalist subagent may avoid handoff issues, but it sacrifices the benefits of specialization and can accumulate excessive context during large codebase exploration. The better fix is improving coordination and state passing, not abandoning the coordinator-subagent pattern.
Your answer is correct
Have the coordinator maintain shared investigation state and include relevant prior findings in each subsequent subagent prompt.
Explanation
This addresses the reliability issue by making the coordinator responsible for carrying forward cross-agent state. Each subagent invocation should receive the information it needs for its assigned task, rather than relying on hidden shared memory or prior conversation context.
Overall explanation
Coordinator-owned state is central to reliable multi-agent orchestration. In a coordinator-subagent pattern, the coordinator decomposes work, collects results, and decides which findings must be supplied to later subagents so they can produce grounded outputs.

The underlying principle is that subagents operate in isolated task contexts. They should not be designed as if they can automatically see prior coordinator conversations or other subagents' outputs. The coordinator should maintain a structured investigation state, such as discovered tables, caller lists, constraints, open questions, and confidence notes, then include the relevant subset in each downstream prompt.

Letting subagents communicate directly weakens the hub-and-spoke architecture by hiding information flow from the coordinator. Replacing specialists with one generalist can create context bloat and reduce the value of parallel specialized analysis. Asking a planning subagent to infer missing dependencies from file names is especially risky because it substitutes guesses for evidence.

Question 53
Correct
Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. Production traces show that mixed requests such as “I moved and need to return the charger from order 8831” alternate unpredictably between get_customer and lookup_order as the first call. In some sessions Claude passes an order number to get_customer; in others it passes a customer name to lookup_order. The current tool catalog exposes only terse autogenerated summaries, and no backend errors are occurring. What change should you make first to improve tool selection reliability?
Your answer is correct
Rewrite each MCP tool description to specify purpose, accepted identifiers, returned fields, edge cases, and boundaries versus related tools.
Explanation
Tool descriptions are the primary signal Claude uses when deciding which tool fits a request. Adding clear purpose, inputs, outputs, edge cases, and boundaries directly addresses unreliable selection between similar tools without adding unnecessary orchestration complexity.
Add a keyword router that maps phrases like “order” or “refund” to one tool before Claude sees the request.
Explanation
Keyword routing is brittle because support requests often contain multiple concepts, such as customer identity, orders, refunds, and returns in one sentence. It can override Claude’s natural language understanding and create new misroutes when users phrase requests unexpectedly.
Consolidate get_customer and lookup_order into one broad lookup tool that chooses internally which backend records to retrieve.
Explanation
A broad catch-all tool can hide important boundaries and make the interface less transparent to the agent. It also introduces unnecessary backend complexity when the immediate issue is that the existing tools are poorly differentiated in the catalog.
Update the system prompt to tell Claude to think carefully before selecting tools, without changing schemas or tool metadata.
Explanation
A vague prompt instruction does not provide the concrete selection criteria Claude needs to distinguish similar tools. It may slightly improve behavior, but it leaves the weak tool catalog unchanged, which is the root reliability problem in this situation.
Overall explanation
Tool descriptions drive tool selection. When tools have overlapping concepts or accept similar identifier formats, Claude relies heavily on the tool name and description to decide which tool to call. Clear descriptions should explain what the tool does, accepted input formats, returned data, edge cases, and when to use it instead of related tools.

Why this works in practice: improving descriptions preserves the existing architecture while giving Claude the information needed to choose reliably between get_customer and lookup_order. This is usually the best first intervention before adding routing layers or redesigning backend interfaces.

Why the distractors fail: keyword routing is an anti-pattern because customer support language is ambiguous and multi-intent; vague “think carefully” prompt guidance does not fix missing tool metadata; and consolidating tools into a broad lookup action can blur boundaries instead of clarifying them. The underlying principle is to make tool interfaces explicit and differentiated so model-driven tool choice has the right information available.

Question 54
Correct
Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. Production logs show that lookup_order and process_refund both return the same failure text, "Operation failed." The agent retries declined refunds, tells customers to try again later when they provided invalid order IDs, and escalates temporary timeout cases that would likely succeed on retry. What change would best improve the agent's recovery decisions?
Retry every failed backend tool call three times, then escalate unresolved cases without exposing error details to Claude.
Explanation
Retries are appropriate for some transient failures, but not for invalid input, policy declines, or permission failures. Applying a fixed retry pattern wastes time and can repeat operations that should be clarified, explained, or escalated.
Standardize every tool failure as a generic message, then ask Claude to infer recovery steps from conversation context.
Explanation
Uniform errors hide the difference between recoverable and nonrecoverable failures. Asking Claude to infer from conversation context encourages guesswork and produces retries or escalations disconnected from backend reality.
Route all refund and order lookup failures to escalate_to_human, avoiding autonomous recovery entirely after backend errors.
Explanation
Escalating all backend failures protects against some mistakes but sacrifices first-contact resolution for cases the agent could handle locally. It also fails to distinguish timeouts, invalid identifiers, policy declines, and authorization problems.
Your answer is correct
Return MCP tool errors with isError plus category, retryability, and safe messages distinguishing transient, validation, business, and permission failures.
Explanation
Categorized tool errors give the agent the signals it needs to choose different recovery paths. Timeouts can be retried, invalid inputs can trigger clarification, business declines can be explained, and permission failures can be escalated or handled according to policy.
Overall explanation
Structured error responses let an agent make different decisions for different failure modes instead of treating every backend problem as the same event. In practice, an MCP tool should use an error signal such as isError and include metadata like errorCategory, isRetryable, and a human-readable explanation that is safe to show or summarize to the customer.

The underlying principle is that recovery logic depends on the nature of the failure: transient errors may be retried, validation errors usually require corrected input, business errors such as policy declines should be explained without retrying, and permission errors may require escalation or access handling. Generic failure text prevents Claude from selecting the right path and often causes wasted retries, premature escalation, or misleading customer responses.

Fixed retry counts are an anti-pattern when used as the primary response to all failures, because they ignore whether the error is actually retryable. Escalating every tool failure is also too conservative for an 80%+ first-contact resolution target, since many cases can be recovered locally with the right error details.

Question 55
Correct
Scenario: Developer Productivity with Claude You are building developer productivity tools using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent helps engineers explore unfamiliar codebases, understand legacy systems, generate boilerplate code, and automate repetitive tasks. It uses built-in tools (Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob) and integrates with MCP servers. Your CI job already invokes Claude Code successfully and posts a single pull request summary comment. The team now wants automated inline comments for each finding, but the integration frequently breaks because Claude sometimes adds prose, changes field names, or formats findings as markdown. What change best supports reliable automation?
Parse Claude's markdown bullets with regular expressions, adding patterns as new review formats appear in CI logs.
Explanation
Parsing natural language or markdown with regular expressions is a brittle automation anti-pattern. It couples the CI integration to presentation details that can change across responses, causing ongoing maintenance and missed findings.
Your answer is correct
Run Claude Code with --output-format json and --json-schema, then map validated findings to inline PR comments.
Explanation
This directly addresses the reliability problem by making Claude Code produce structured output that downstream automation can parse consistently. A JSON schema defines the expected fields, reducing brittle dependencies on prose, markdown formatting, or field naming variations.
Strengthen the review prompt to demand valid JSON only, then reject responses containing markdown or explanatory text.
Explanation
Prompt instructions can improve formatting but do not provide the same enforcement as structured CLI output with a schema. Rejecting malformed responses also creates avoidable CI failures instead of preventing inconsistent output at the interface boundary.
Store the prior summary comment and ask Claude to rewrite it into comment-ready records on a second pass.
Explanation
A second pass may sometimes normalize output, but it still relies on model behavior rather than a schema-backed output contract. It also adds latency and can lose information if the original summary omitted details needed for inline comments.
Overall explanation
Reliable CI automation needs structured contracts. When Claude Code output feeds another system, such as an inline pull request comment publisher, the integration should not depend on prose conventions or markdown layout. Using --output-format json with --json-schema gives the pipeline a predictable structure to validate and transform into review comments.

Prompt-only formatting is weaker. Asking for JSON in natural language can reduce errors, but it does not provide the same machine-oriented boundary as schema-constrained CLI output. Rejecting responses after the fact shifts the problem into CI failure handling rather than designing the interface correctly.

Brittle parsing is an anti-pattern. Regular expressions over markdown bullets or conversational summaries are fragile because the model may change phrasing, ordering, or formatting while still giving a useful review. A second normalization pass can help in some workflows, but it adds cost and latency while remaining less reliable than producing structured output at the source.

Question 56
Correct
Scenario: Structured Data Extraction You are building a structured data extraction system using Claude. The system extracts information from unstructured documents, validates output using JSON schemas, and maintains high accuracy. It must handle edge cases gracefully and integrate with downstream systems. In validation runs, 18% of supplier contracts return null for effective_date and renewal_terms even though human reviewers find the information present. The misses cluster in documents where dates and renewal language appear in cover letters, footnotes, or table captions rather than standard contract header sections. Outputs are otherwise schema-valid, and downstream systems can accept null only when the source truly omits the field. What change would most improve extraction accuracy?
Retry every extraction with null fields until the model returns populated values for all contract metadata fields.
Explanation
Retries can help with format or validation errors, but repeated retries without new guidance do not address the underlying pattern of missed locations. This approach wastes processing and can pressure the model to invent values when fields are genuinely absent.
Append a rule telling Claude that null values are unacceptable whenever the document is classified as a supplier contract.
Explanation
A blanket prohibition on nulls is an anti-pattern for extraction tasks because absence is sometimes a valid outcome. This would likely reduce empty fields by encouraging guessing rather than improving accurate extraction.
Your answer is correct
Add targeted few-shot examples showing the fields extracted from cover-letter text, footnotes, and table captions with brief rationale.
Explanation
Targeted few-shot examples are well suited when the model misses information because source documents use varied structures. Showing representative formats teaches Claude how to generalize where to look while still returning null when the information is truly absent.
Change the schema to make effective_date and renewal_terms required non-null fields, rejecting outputs that leave either value empty.
Explanation
Making fields non-null forces schema compliance but does not teach the model where the information appears in unusual layouts. It also increases the risk of fabricated values when the source truly omits the information.
Overall explanation
Targeted few-shot examples are the best fit when extraction failures cluster around varied document structures. Showing examples where the same field appears in a cover letter, a footnote, or a table caption helps Claude learn the intended judgment pattern, not just the output format.

The key principle is that examples should address the source of ambiguity. Here, the issue is not JSON syntax or schema validity, since outputs already validate. The issue is recognizing that required business facts may appear outside conventional sections, while still preserving the ability to return null when the source truly lacks the information.

Changing fields to non-null, banning nulls by instruction, or retrying until values appear are anti-patterns because they can convert uncertainty into hallucinated data. Schema constraints and retries are useful for enforcing structure or correcting recoverable validation failures, but they do not replace examples that demonstrate how to extract from varied source layouts.

Question 57
Correct
Scenario: Developer Productivity with Claude You are building developer productivity tools using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent helps engineers explore unfamiliar codebases, understand legacy systems, generate boilerplate code, and automate repetitive tasks. It uses built-in tools (Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob) and integrates with MCP servers. Engineers often ask the agent to generate new scheduled jobs with brief prompts like "add cleanup for expired sessions." The generated code compiles, but reviewers repeatedly find missing decisions around idempotency, tenant scoping, observability naming, data retention exceptions, and operational rollback. These requirements vary across teams and are not reliably documented in one place. What refinement approach should you apply before the agent begins implementation?
Ask Claude to implement only the simplest cleanup path first, then rely on code review to discover missing requirements.
Explanation
This treats human review as the primary requirements discovery mechanism, which creates avoidable rework and reviewer fatigue. Iterative refinement is more effective when uncertainty is surfaced before coding rather than after a partially wrong implementation exists.
Tell Claude to infer the missing conventions from nearby scheduled jobs and implement the most common observed pattern.
Explanation
Inferring from nearby code can help with style, but it is risky when requirements vary by team and are not consistently documented. This encourages the agent to guess hidden business and operational requirements rather than eliciting them explicitly.
Your answer is correct
Have Claude ask targeted clarification questions about operational constraints, ownership assumptions, and edge cases before proposing implementation changes.
Explanation
This applies the interview pattern, which is useful when the developer may not know all relevant considerations upfront. By eliciting missing requirements before implementation, Claude can avoid producing plausible but misaligned boilerplate that later requires reviewer-driven rework.
Add a global CLAUDE.md instruction requiring all scheduled jobs to handle every possible edge case conservatively.
Explanation
A broad always-loaded instruction is too vague to resolve team-specific decisions like retention exceptions, metrics names, and rollback behavior. It also risks adding irrelevant context to unrelated tasks without forcing the missing requirements to be clarified.
Overall explanation
Correct approach: When important requirements are missing or implicit, the best refinement technique is to have Claude ask targeted questions before implementation. This interview pattern helps surface assumptions the developer may not have anticipated, such as ownership boundaries, operational constraints, failure behavior, and edge cases.

Underlying principle: Iterative refinement is not only about fixing generated code after the fact. For ambiguous development tasks, refinement should start by improving the problem definition so the agent implements against explicit constraints instead of plausible guesses.

Asking Claude to infer requirements from nearby files is an anti-pattern when conventions vary across teams, because similar code may reflect different operational assumptions. A vague global instruction in CLAUDE.md cannot replace task-specific clarification, and relying on code review to uncover missing requirements delays feedback until after rework has already been created.

Question 58
Correct
Scenario: Multi-Agent Research System You are building a multi-agent research system using the Claude Agent SDK. A coordinator agent delegates to specialized subagents: one searches the web, one analyzes documents, one synthesizes findings, and one generates reports. The system researches topics and produces comprehensive, cited reports. Your web search MCP tool occasionally times out. Today it returns a content block reading "Search provider timeout, try again later" as if the call succeeded. The synthesis subagent sometimes treats that text as a source note, and the report generator includes unsupported citations. What tool response change best prevents the model from confusing failures with valid research content?
Convert failures into empty successful result lists, allowing the coordinator to proceed without additional error-handling complexity.
Explanation
An empty successful result means the query ran correctly and found no matches, which is different from a timeout. Hiding failures as empty results prevents the coordinator from retrying, changing strategy, or reporting coverage gaps.
Keep returning error text as normal content, but instruct synthesis to ignore passages containing timeout or unavailable.
Explanation
This relies on parsing natural language inside successful tool content, which is brittle and easy to miss. It also fails when error wording changes or when legitimate source text contains similar words.
Raise uncaught server exceptions for all failures, letting the agent infer failure details from transport-level interruptions.
Explanation
Transport-level interruption gives the agent less useful context than an explicit tool failure response. It can also break the agentic loop instead of returning information the coordinator can reason about and recover from.
Your answer is correct
Return failed tool calls with isError set true, plus concise diagnostic content the subagent can use for recovery.
Explanation
MCP tools should distinguish failed executions from successful content using the isError pattern. This lets the agent treat the response as a tool failure rather than as research material, enabling retries, alternative searches, or coverage-gap annotations.
Overall explanation
Correct approach: MCP tools should communicate failed executions as failures, not as ordinary content. Setting isError on the tool result tells the agent that the returned content is diagnostic information, not evidence to cite or synthesize.

Underlying principle: agents need machine-readable signals to separate valid empty results from tool failures. Once a timeout is marked as an error, the coordinator or subagent can retry, use an alternate source, or annotate a coverage gap instead of accidentally treating the message as research content.

Anti-patterns: Asking the model to infer errors from phrases like "timeout" or "unavailable" is brittle natural language parsing. Returning an empty successful list silently suppresses an access failure, while uncaught exceptions can terminate or obscure the workflow rather than enabling intelligent recovery.

Question 59
Correct
Scenario: Structured Data Extraction You are building a structured data extraction system using Claude. The system extracts information from unstructured documents, validates output using JSON schemas, and maintains high accuracy. It must handle edge cases gracefully and integrate with downstream systems. A labeled validation run reports 97.2% aggregate extraction accuracy across NDAs, invoices, insurance forms, and purchase orders. Leadership wants to bypass human review for any record where Claude returns high confidence, but pilot complaints suggest errors cluster in specific document families and fields. What should you do before reducing reviewer coverage?
Your answer is correct
Analyze accuracy by document type and extracted field, then automate only segments meeting validated thresholds while routing others to review.
Explanation
Aggregate accuracy can hide weak performance in specific document types or fields. Segment-level validation lets you safely automate areas that are proven reliable while preserving human review for underperforming or uncertain slices.
Raise the global confidence threshold until the aggregate validation accuracy reaches 99%, then disable review for remaining outputs.
Explanation
A higher global threshold does not prove that every document type and field performs acceptably. Some fields may still be error-prone even when the model is highly confident, so calibration must be checked at the relevant segment level.
Randomly review a fixed percentage of every extraction category, regardless of document type, field, or prior validation performance.
Explanation
Uniform review sampling ignores known differences in risk and accuracy across document types and fields. It may over-review reliable segments while under-reviewing fields that need targeted human attention.
Use the 97.2% aggregate accuracy to auto-approve all high-confidence outputs, monitoring user complaints for emerging regressions.
Explanation
Relying on aggregate accuracy is risky because high overall performance can mask concentrated failures in specific segments. Waiting for user complaints makes customers and downstream systems the detection mechanism, which is unsuitable for a high-accuracy extraction workflow.
Overall explanation
Segment-level validation is required before reducing human review in structured extraction systems. A strong aggregate accuracy number can hide poor performance on a particular document family, such as NDAs, or on a particular field, such as renewal dates or insurance policy exclusions.

The correct approach is to evaluate accuracy by document type and field, then automate only the segments that meet validated performance thresholds. Segments with lower accuracy, ambiguous source evidence, or insufficient labeled data should continue routing to human review until they are calibrated and validated.

Using aggregate accuracy alone is an anti-pattern because it can create false confidence and push clustered errors into downstream systems. Raising a global confidence threshold has a similar flaw: model confidence must be calibrated against labeled validation data, and calibration can vary by field and document type. Uniform random review is useful for monitoring, but it is not a substitute for risk-aware routing based on observed segment performance.

Question 60
Correct
Scenario: Structured Data Extraction You are building a structured data extraction system using Claude. The system extracts information from unstructured documents, validates output using JSON schemas, and maintains high accuracy. It must handle edge cases gracefully and integrate with downstream systems. During evaluation, the extraction pipeline handles supplier contracts by first asking Claude to infer document-specific extraction rules, then asking the same conversation to review the resulting field values. Human auditors find that the review step often misses subtle errors introduced by the inferred rules, such as treating renewal notice dates as contract end dates. You need to improve review effectiveness without changing the extraction schema. What architecture should you use?
Run three self-review turns in the original conversation and accept fields only when all turns report high confidence.
Explanation
Repeated self-review turns in the same conversation still share the original context and may repeat the same blind spots. Self-reported confidence is not a reliable proxy for correctness unless calibrated separately against labeled validation data.
Append the extraction rationale to the review prompt so Claude can verify whether each reasoning step was internally consistent.
Explanation
Reviewing the original rationale can reinforce the same mistaken assumptions that caused the extraction error. The goal is to independently compare extracted values to the source and rubric, not validate whether the original reasoning sounded coherent.
Ask the same conversation to self-critique its extraction using extended thinking and a stricter instruction to find mistakes.
Explanation
Self-review in the same session is less effective because the model retains the reasoning context that led to the original decision. A stricter instruction may help somewhat, but it does not remove the anchoring effect from the generation context.
Your answer is correct
Run a separate Claude review instance with the source document, extracted fields, and rubric, excluding the original extraction reasoning.
Explanation
A separate review instance avoids carrying over the assumptions and reasoning that produced the original extraction. This makes the reviewer more likely to question subtle field placement errors and compare the extraction directly against the source and rubric.
Overall explanation
Independent review instances are more effective when the concern is that the same reasoning context that generated an extraction also influences its review. Providing a separate Claude instance with only the source document, extracted fields, and an explicit review rubric creates a cleaner evaluation setup that can challenge assumptions rather than inherit them.

The underlying principle is context isolation: a reviewer should not be anchored by the generator's intermediate rationale when checking whether values are supported by the source. This is especially important for subtle semantic errors, such as confusing a renewal notice date with a contract end date, where the extraction may be schema-valid but substantively wrong.

Asking the same conversation to self-critique, adding more thinking, or repeating self-review turns does not remove the original assumptions. Appending the extraction rationale can make the problem worse by encouraging the reviewer to assess internal consistency rather than source-grounded correctness. Confidence scores can support routing when calibrated with labeled validation sets, but they should not replace an independent review architecture.
